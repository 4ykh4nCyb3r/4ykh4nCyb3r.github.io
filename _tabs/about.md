I’m a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at BME specializing in Software Engineering with a strong focus on Cybersecurity, Penetration Testing, and DevSecOps. As a self-taught ethical hacker, I hold multiple industry-recognized certifications, including OSCP+, OSWP, and CRTA (Certified Red Team Analyst). My hands-on experience comes from freelance security research on HackerOne, performing web penetration testing and identifying vulnerabilities such as XSS, IDOR, SQL injection, and race conditions. I have also developed security-focused projects, including SiFT (Secure File Transfer Protocol), a CI/CD DevOps pipeline project, and an automated XSS web scanner, gaining practical skills in applied cryptography, automation, and secure software development.

This blog is my space to document and share my journey in cybersecurity and DevSecOps. You’ll find detailed box walkthroughs, CTF write-ups, project demos, OSCP preparation notes, and hands-on exercises from platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and Proving Grounds. My portfolio also showcases my personal projects, completed courses, earned certifications, and posts about DevSecOps and secure software practices — reflecting my continuous learning and commitment to building practical offensive security expertise.

Whether you’re just starting out or already in the field, I hope these resources and insights help you grow your skills alongside mine.
