I’m a passionate learner diving deep into the world of Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing. I’m currently pursuing a Computer Science degree while sharpening my practical skills by solving boxes on platforms like Proving Grounds Practice (PG-Practice), Hack The Box (HTB), and TryHackMe. I’m also currently preparing for the OSCP exam, using these platforms to build and refine my offensive security skills.

This blog is my space to document and share my journey—expect detailed box walkthroughs, CTF writeups, and other cybersecurity-related content. Whether you’re just starting out or already in the field, I hope you find something helpful here.
