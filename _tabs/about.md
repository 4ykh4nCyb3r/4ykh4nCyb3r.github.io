I'm a passionate learner diving deep into the world of Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing. I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science degree while sharpening my practical skills by solving boxes on platforms like Proving Grounds Practice (PG-Practice), Hack The Box (HTB), and TryHackMe.

This blog is my space to document and share my journeyâ€”expect detailed box walkthroughs, CTF writeups, and other cybersecurity-related content. Whether you're just starting out or already in the field, I hope you find something helpful here.
