I’m a passionate learner diving deep into the world of Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing. I hold the OSCP certification and am pursuing a Computer Science degree while also studying Software Engineering. I continuously sharpen my practical skills by solving challenges on platforms like Proving Grounds Practice (PG-Practice), Hack The Box (HTB), and TryHackMe. These experiences help me build and refine my offensive security expertise.

This blog is my space to document and share my journey—expect detailed box walkthroughs, CTF writeups, and other cybersecurity-related content. Whether you’re just starting out or already in the field, I hope you find something helpful here.
