### <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i> [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
- **Certified Penetration Tester Specialist (CPTS) Path**

I completed the HackTheBox Academy Certified Penetration Tester Specialist Path, consisting of 28 modules tailored for individuals starting in information security and aspiring to become professional penetration testers. This path provided a solid foundation in core security assessment concepts, tools, and real-world penetration testing methodologies. I gained hands-on expertise in all engagement stagesâ€”reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reportingâ€”through practical labs, enabling me to perform intermediate-level security assessments on enterprise infrastructure with confidence.

### <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> [TCM Security Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/)
- **Practical Ethical Hacking**
- **Linux Privilege Escalation**
- **Windows Privilege Escalation**

I completed the Practical Ethical Hacking, Linux Privilege Escalation, and Windows Privilege Escalation courses by [Heath Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathadams/), designed for aspiring ethical hackers. These courses provided in-depth knowledge in reconnaissance, scanning, and exploitation with tools like Metasploit, alongside hands-on experience in Active Directory attacks (e.g., kerberoasting, pass-the-hash) and web application testing focused on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. I honed my Linux and Windows privilege escalation techniques through practical labs, mastering post-exploitation, wireless attacks, notekeeping, and report writing, preparing me for professional penetration testing engagements.

### <i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Aquincum Institute of Technology ([AIT Budapest](https://www.ait-budapest.com/))
- **Applied Cryptography**

I am enrolled in the Applied Cryptography course at AIT Budapest, taught by [Levente ButtyÃ¡n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/levente-butty%C3%A1n-447b97/?originalSubdomain=hu). This course explores Symmetric Key Cryptography, Asymmetric Key Cryptography, and their applications in securing data and communications. Through hands-on labs, homework, and a final project designing a secure protocol similar to FTP (SiFT), I am gaining practical experience in implementing cryptographic systems and solving real-world security challenges.

### <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> [Tib3rius Institute for Cybersecurity](https://courses.tib3rius.com/p/privilege-escalation-for-oscp-and-beyond-bundle?coupon_code=TWITTER)
- **Linux Privilege Escalation**
- **Windows Privilege Escalation**

I completed the Linux and Windows Privilege Escalation courses from Tib3rius Institute, tailored for penetration testers preparing for certifications like OSCP. In the Linux course, I mastered techniques like exploiting SUID binaries, cron jobs, and file permissions using tools like LinPEAS. The Windows course taught me to leverage misconfigured services, weak registry permissions, and kernel exploits with tools like WinPEAS and PowerUp. Through hands-on labs with vulnerable VMs, I developed a systematic approach to privilege escalation, enhancing my ability to execute precise exploits in real-world scenarios.

## Hands-On Labs

I actively engage with platforms like PortSwigger Labs, Proving Grounds, and Hack The Box to refine my penetration testing skills. PortSwigger Labs strengthen my web application pentesting expertise, focusing on vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS using Burp Suite. Proving Grounds and Hack The Box enhance my network penetration testing, privilege escalation, and Active Directory attack skills through real-world scenarios. These labs allow me to apply theoretical knowledge, refine methodologies, and develop critical thinking for effective security assessments.
