## Introduction
In this walkthrough we will be solving Proving Grounds Intermediate Windows box Medjed. Letâ€™s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP Scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV --open $IP
```

## Services

### Port 139/445

Run enum4linux to check if we can access the machine using null or anonymous credentials

```bash
 enum4linux $IP
```

### Port 3306

Remote login is not allowed

### Port 30021

Anonymous login is allowed

**But nothing of special interest was found in here.**

## Web

### Port 8000

- Remember this for privilege escalation [Barracuda6.5-LocalPrivEsc](https://github.com/boku7/BarracudaDrivev6.5-LocalPrivEsc/blob/master/README.md)
- Found in web file manager under C:\xampp

## Exploitation

When accessing the web page it says the configuration wizard must be filled  before interacting so we can go and set an admin user:

We can see xampp server suite is present on the target machine

I see that target server can run Lua shells, I am gonna try to uploaded **rev.lsp** under **xampp\htdocs** and access it from browser which should return me a reverse shell.

Even if Apache itself runs as a limited user (e.g., `LocalService`), **it may be spawning the Lua interpreter as SYSTEM**, *especially* if:

- The Lua interpreter is installed as a service running as SYSTEM.
- You misconfigured the Apache handler or CGI setup to run Lua with higher privileges.

Now we are NT authority\system.

## Mitigation

- **Restrict Web Root Access:** Ensure that the web application does not expose sensitive directories like the entire filesystem. Limit access strictly to required directories, such as the web root (e.g., `xampp/htdocs`).
- **Disable Unused Interpreters:** If Lua scripting is not essential for the application, disable its interpreter on the server. This reduces the attack surface significantly.
- **Implement File Upload Restrictions:** If file upload is allowed, validate file extensions and MIME types, and store uploads outside the web root to prevent direct execution.
